Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about T@@ eh@@ er@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disp@@ uted two state solution .
relations between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atom@@ ic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time im@@ pending in Israel .
in 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting Gir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college prof@@ essor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lam@@ b made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand @-@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school &apos;s camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well @-@ liked history prof@@ essor , E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
he said Lam@@ b made the f@@ ateful 9@@ 11 call some@@ time after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ul@@ ty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
the details released by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a tal@@ ented but possibly trou@@ bled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmi@@ dt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 fac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
a student who pra@@ ised Lam@@ b , Brand@@ on be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ ter@@ y , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hi@@ ring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic ten@@ ure track to become an assi@@ stant prof@@ essor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later picked up Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he cro@@ ssed back into Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be ap@@ preh@@ ended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38 @-@ cali@@ ber pi@@ stol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the ou@@ ts@@ kir@@ ts of Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el John@@ son .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though John@@ son said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lam@@ b grew up in the area .
lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geogra@@ phy and education classes .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of Lam@@ b &apos;s lon@@ g@@ time friends described him as smart , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun@@ ny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the he@@ art@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson sub@@ ur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a dog named Li@@ gh@@ tn@@ ing that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; ex @-@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; she was completely dev@@ ast@@ ated , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and A@@ big@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occa@@ sional gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writ@@ es and sin@@ gs her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mi@@ ke Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of Sep@@ t . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crow@@ d .
there was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cutting up and thro@@ wing one @-@ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wi@@ t about them .
Schmi@@ dt , the sla@@ in prof@@ essor , directed the first @-@ year seminar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don Al@@ lan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English prof@@ essor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his f@@ rat@@ ernity and student government .
on the Delta State camp@@ us in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a c@@ and@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Schmi@@ dt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother Je@@ ff Schmi@@ dt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir s@@ ang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gra@@ ce . &quot;
classes resume Wednesday .
&quot; we &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
associated Press writers E@@ mi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , and Re@@ be@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmi@@ dt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .
toys R Us Plans to H@@ ire Fe@@ wer Holiday Se@@ as@@ on Wor@@ kers
toys R Us says it won &apos;t hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year , but the to@@ y and baby products re@@ ta@@ iler says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .

UN Chief Sa@@ ys There Is No Mili@@ tary Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s step@@ ped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to un@@ ite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l Num@@ bers T@@ hat Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a fli@@ p @-@ flo@@ pper .
others have dis@@ missed him as a jo@@ ke .
and some are holding out for an imp@@ lo@@ sion .
but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from at@@ op the poll@@ s , it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national poll@@ s have shown Donald Trump &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nom@@ ination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogni@@ zing Trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some recent po@@ ll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Trump &apos;s favor@@ ability rat@@ ings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University po@@ ll showed only two in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac po@@ ll in I@@ o@@ wa last week found that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans there had a favor@@ able view of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ OP voters would be happy with Trump as the nom@@ ine@@ e .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C po@@ ll last week , 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusi@@ astic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusi@@ astic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nom@@ ine@@ e .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temper@@ a@@ ment as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republi@@ can voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ a@@ ment to be president , according to Monday &apos;s AB@@ C News / Washington Post po@@ ll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation cau@@ cus state of I@@ o@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality to be comm@@ ander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 indepen@@ dents say his temper@@ a@@ ment does not belong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pun@@ dit h@@ ats , Republi@@ can voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ OP nom@@ ination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C po@@ ll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ OP voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nom@@ ination , v@@ s. only 28 percent for event@@ ual nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ OP voters see Trump &apos;s campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if Re@@ public@@ ans r@@ al@@ lied around another candidate , Trump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ l@@ inter@@ ed field is likely contributing to Trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trump support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a do@@ zen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University po@@ ll in early September shows that , in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Trump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bio by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a bare majority of Donald Trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T po@@ ll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
still , Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conver@@ sation .
some are worried that Trump &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post po@@ ll , six in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Trump and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republi@@ can voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
six in 10 Re@@ public@@ ans in Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post po@@ ll say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
and they are an@@ gr@@ y at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg po@@ ll in I@@ o@@ wa from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ o@@ wa Re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated with Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential developments are located here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea mu@@ df@@ lat@@ s .
on this road one square met@@ re of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &quot; says a study - hence the high prices .
this new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square met@@ re .
of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student di@@ gs in Munich is not really low .
compared with Germany &apos;s top areas , however , this price seems li@@ kes pe@@ an@@ uts .
property service En@@ gel &amp; Vol@@ kers has published a le@@ ague table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square met@@ re .
more than € 10,000 is nothing there - per qu@@ are met@@ re , mind you .
OK , if you can &apos;t afford it ...
inci@@ dentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and G@@ Ö@@ T@@ ZE
double goal sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
a lu@@ cky goal from Thomas Müller pav@@ ed the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Ol@@ yp@@ i@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it got better .
a confident start to the Champi@@ ons League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario G@@ Ö@@ T@@ ZE brought about a dream start to their &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the se@@ e@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
tra@@ iner P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champi@@ ons League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller &apos;s bra@@ ce ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and G@@ Ö@@ T@@ ZE &apos;s goal ( 8@@ 9@@ th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the tro@@ phy back to Munich .
with his 28@@ th goal in the Champi@@ ons League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gra@@ cious help of O@@ ly@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ ali@@ e Ro@@ berto , who let through a cross shot from the world champi@@ on .
&quot; we aren &apos;t going to under@@ estimate them , &quot; promised Bayern cap@@ tain Phil@@ li@@ pp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
they demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won their six most recent premi@@ ere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dor@@ t@@ mund st@@ umb@@ led here too .
but Bayern , un@@ defe@@ ated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
attacks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely got past former Brun@@ swi@@ ck player O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field dro@@ ve into the top left corner of the goal .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champi@@ on missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ ow@@ ski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the P@@ ole &apos;s he@@ ader from the line in the 26@@ th minute .
then with a shot which the go@@ ali@@ e par@@ ried with his kne@@ e in the 35@@ th minute .
although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus were able to need@@ le them .
but they could count on go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Al@@ ba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario G@@ Ö@@ T@@ ZE , back in the squ@@ ad following mus@@ cle problems , initially sat on the si@@ delines .
the world cup her@@ o had only been given the green light following final training , said S@@ porting Director Mat@@ thias Sam@@ mer on Sky : &quot; if anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being mali@@ cious . &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the stri@@ cken Le@@ wand@@ ow@@ ski in the 59@@ th minute .
G@@ Ö@@ T@@ ZE came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
after a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing mas@@ ks , had apparently pro@@ v@@ oked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus from behind their f@@ ence with words and gest@@ ures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kers at a greater risk of losing te@@ eth
smo@@ kers damage not only their l@@ ungs but also their te@@ eth , concludes a long @-@ term study in Pots@@ dam .
the good news is : if you give up the risk decre@@ ases fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their te@@ eth early .
this emer@@ ges from a long @-@ term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for N@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Pots@@ dam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their te@@ eth pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely is between 2.5 and 3.@@ 6 times higher for smo@@ kers .
the scientists monitored more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
the main reasons for to@@ oth loss are c@@ aries and inf@@ lam@@ mation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
smoking is a risk factor for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , emphasise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of te@@ eth can therefore be attri@@ buted to more frequent g@@ um inf@@ lam@@ mation in smo@@ kers .
it has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research . &quot;
it could however take 10 years before the danger once more dro@@ ps to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich of the University of Bir@@ m@@ ingham in England .
people should be persu@@ aded to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the li@@ fes@@ pan . &quot;
not smoking is good for the l@@ ungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by to@@ oth@@ less@@ ness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early to@@ oth loss .
the new long term study substan@@ ti@@ ates these findings .
archae@@ ologi@@ sts discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
archae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archae@@ ologi@@ sts from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Bou@@ levard is being constructed , said museum Director Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been in search of so @-@ called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
the museum , as the department for archae@@ ological monu@@ ment conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
the archae@@ ologi@@ sts made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Bou@@ levard .
it is already known from text documents that a for@@ tress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8@@ th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
besides the remains of the for@@ tress and the church tower , a c@@ em@@ eter@@ y with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belon@@ ged to the church , has also been discovered .
young woman hit by goods train
after a young woman met with an accident at the station in Gei@@ len@@ kir@@ chen @-@ lin@@ dern , police are asking for help from the general public .
early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman cro@@ ssed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal police she suffered severe in@@ juries from the accident .
she was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by am@@ bul@@ ance .
investig@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
it is possible that the event was observed by witn@@ esses or residents may have heard something .
this may apply to residents of or people passing by the lin@@ dern station , Zie@@ gel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24 @-@ hour police hot@@ line on 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in contro@@ vers@@ y over TT@@ IP
to def@@ use the contro@@ vers@@ y over the planned Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitr@@ ation system .
according to this , the disp@@ uted private arbitr@@ ation board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
&quot; we want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cec@@ ili@@ a Mal@@ ström , when introducing it .
the Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government has announced its support .
the creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current arbitr@@ ation procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come in equal propor@@ tions from the EU , the USA and from non @-@ member countries .
for the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
this would allow for appe@@ als to be made against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitr@@ ator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
in the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , commented Mal@@ ström .
in the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
in this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
investor State Dis@@ pu@@ te Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the sti@@ ff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
traditional arbitr@@ ation courts are critic@@ ised by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pa@@ yers , make national laws n@@ ull and vo@@ id , or enforce a lower@@ ing of consumer and environmental protection standards .
in initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
there was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ ETA ) .
the German Secretary of State for the Economy , Mat@@ thias MA@@ CH@@ NI@@ G ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
the Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Econom@@ ics Minister Si@@ g@@ mar G@@ abri@@ el developed with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitr@@ ation courts is off the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe war@@ ned against restric@@ ting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
when talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
the issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
it was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
this date is no longer ten@@ able .
exquisite folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens si@@ ts on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
beside him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y @-@ se@@ em@@ ing folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Mi@@ chi@@ gan in felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Ste@@ vens &apos;s performance .
referring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his me@@ ticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly contri@@ ved songs .
where they origin@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
since then Ste@@ vens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
his third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mi@@ chi@@ gan : the Great Lake State , &quot; released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ ft at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
rum@@ our has it that &quot; Mi@@ chi@@ gan &quot; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
but in 2004 in the Rhine area , &quot; S@@ even Sw@@ ans &quot; came out , bur@@ sting positive expectations .
Ste@@ vens seems to have down@@ sized here .
playing live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later the New York @-@ based musi@@ cian returns to his series .
with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens Inv@@ ites You To : come On Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 , a widely acc@@ laimed master@@ piece is released .
ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and styli@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
the album climb@@ s the American B@@ ill@@ board char@@ ts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influ@@ ential music press .
after extremely productive experiments Ste@@ vens then serves up &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , an elabor@@ ate electronic set piece .
this sixth proper studio album is still broadly or@@ chest@@ rated , but supported by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and e@@ cho@@ es .
long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colour@@ ful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent stage decor@@ ations .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens is tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five @-@ man band .
Hamburg M@@ ehr kept in the dark !
since March the theatre has primarily presented &quot; Car@@ rie and Lo@@ well . &quot;
although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Ste@@ vens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk .
without direc@@ ting a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enri@@ ched album .
from the audience one can hear : the performance is more &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and it makes you want to &quot; ch@@ u@@ ck away the album . &quot;
only with his en@@ core does Ste@@ vens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acou@@ stically and finally take a bow to th@@ under@@ ous applause .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s de@@ but at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awa@@ ited
new Labour leader Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions later , taking on David Cam@@ eron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six all@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrut@@ in@@ ised by the media and Labour MP@@ s .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could ski@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cab@@ inet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the sin@@ ging of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MP@@ s and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; her@@ o@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told B@@ BC T@@ wo &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abolished .
nearly a do@@ zen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , c@@ iting differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
B@@ BC political correspon@@ dent Rob@@ in Bran@@ t says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secre@@ tary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only op@@ posing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ eron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cam@@ eron and has been given more than 3@@ 0,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both &quot; repar@@ tee &quot; and trading barb@@ s , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angel@@ a E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secre@@ tary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cam@@ eron is travelling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had appro@@ ached the Comm@@ ons Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ co@@ w to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cam@@ eron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; Pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first tel@@ ev@@ ised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s judgement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MP@@ s although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

po@@ und rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
the po@@ und jum@@ ped following data showing a pick @-@ up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target S@@ AB@@ Mil@@ ler .
between May and July , UK earnings excluding bon@@ uses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 55@@ 05 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
S@@ AB@@ Mil@@ ler was the stand @-@ out stock on the market , jum@@ ping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ wei@@ ser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
Ri@@ chem@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
shares in G@@ len@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share placement as part of its debt @-@ cutting strategy .
shares in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jum@@ p in half @-@ year pre @-@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m.
J@@ D Sports bo@@ ss says higher wages could h@@ urt expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Co@@ w@@ gi@@ ll says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the po@@ ckets of potential consumers . &quot;
but that spending power is unlikely to out@@ wei@@ gh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Justi@@ n B@@ ie@@ ber in the capital city : on a B@@ ie@@ ber expe@@ dition in Berlin
Justi@@ n B@@ ie@@ ber , me@@ gast@@ ar .
a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous 21 years young , a wi@@ mp@@ y k@@ id with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
the guy with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
probably even more .
at the moment Mon@@ si@@ eur B@@ ie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the under @-@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ z@@ ins@@ ka .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name Rit@@ z Car@@ l@@ ton .
not so bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justi@@ n yesterday .
including E@@ va and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
but the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Pots@@ damer Platz since 7 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
the B@@ ie@@ ber building : their i@@ do@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of po@@ sters in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
the suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in six months .
at least .
she says : &quot; my Vi@@ kt@@ oria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the gram@@ mar school at the moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &quot;
compulsory education ?
who wants that ?
not the fans .
nor B@@ ie@@ ber himself .
he is financially secure anyway .
he is ear@@ ning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bo@@ w@@ l , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ spot company po@@ urs many many dollars into B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s account .
and for every dol@@ l that looks like him and passes over the counter B@@ ie@@ ber cas@@ hes in as well .
when Justi@@ n B@@ ie@@ ber drinks coffee people go@@ ggle through the window .
he has lo@@ oted more than a hundred million like that .
some say the h@@ ype goes too far .
others point out that after all B@@ ie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number one .
B@@ ie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
at least that &apos;s what he says .
Pe@@ gi@@ da po@@ ster suggests the idea of pot@@ ato don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s to Leb@@ anese man
pot@@ ato@@ es or don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab ?
you can have both - in the pot@@ ato k@@ eb@@ ab that Ol@@ denburg sn@@ ack bar owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has created .
inspired by the s@@ log@@ an &quot; pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement po@@ ster , Al@@ ha@@ y put pot@@ ato@@ es and meat together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
a po@@ ster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the s@@ log@@ an &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and pot@@ ato@@ es has been rot@@ ating in his shop .
&quot; that is multi @-@ cultural food ! &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
according to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
because of this , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many pot@@ ato@@ es the sp@@ it holds .
just enough so that , &quot; Th@@ ey taste much better together , &quot; he reck@@ ons .
customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches gra@@ ss@@ roots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di ons@@ lau@@ ght in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ cer@@ y wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has ki@@ cked off a gra@@ ss@@ roots campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
as Al@@ di pre@@ pa@@ res to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through main@@ stream and social media marketing and events such as the A@@ del@@ ai@@ de show .
IG@@ A retailers and suppliers are jum@@ ping on board , with brands such as Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough @-@ based ice cream maker Sim@@ mo &apos;s offering taste testing at IG@@ A stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Austra@@ lian football le@@ ague tickets to lo@@ yal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , li@@ qu@@ or and hardware wholes@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Austra@@ lian and Western Austra@@ lian sh@@ opp@@ ers are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and IG@@ A retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , an@@ al@@ yst@@ s such as Mor@@ gan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , Mor@@ gan Stan@@ ley analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Ro@@ y Mor@@ gan survey found IG@@ A sh@@ opp@@ ers were most lo@@ yal .
Mor@@ gan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 2016 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 201@@ 8 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Mel@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has dec@@ lined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1200 IG@@ A retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating dele@@ verage as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholes@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching sh@@ elf prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping IG@@ A retailers refurbis@@ h stores by adding faster @-@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ c@@ eries .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refurbis@@ h@@ ment programs are gaining trac@@ tion and is hoping the wholes@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is backed by Tennis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ al@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been the col@@ lateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ al@@ y .
Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the tal@@ ented du@@ o regularly referred to as the &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was dra@@ gged into an un@@ welcome spot@@ light by the in@@ famous K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os sle@@ dge of St@@ an Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Ma@@ sters .
in a fi@@ ery quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his oppon@@ ent Ry@@ an Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separated by the chair um@@ p@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declar@@ ing : &quot; Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka should &apos;ve de@@ cked K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that k@@ id . &quot;
while he was last seen sm@@ as@@ hing a rac@@ quet after cra@@ mp fo@@ iled a potential US Open up@@ set of Richard Gas@@ quet , Ko@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been def@@ ended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ al@@ y .
the te@@ en@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bern@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dra@@ gged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
he did break a rac@@ quet when he lost when he cra@@ mp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rac@@ quet out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he w@@ ouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he h@@ as@@ n &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the lo@@ cker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , descri@@ bing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @-@ term fi@@ x@@ ture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
and I think N@@ ick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary decla@@ res emergency , se@@ als border , deta@@ ins migrants
declar@@ ing a state of emergency , Hungary se@@ aled off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and de@@ tained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants po@@ uring in .
cha@@ os ensu@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ tra@@ ge .
stu@@ ck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; check@@ points , those fle@@ eing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched ten@@ ts and settled in .
but fru@@ str@@ ations were on the rise .
as a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed above , migrants chan@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ ou@@ ted insul@@ ts at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not col@@ lateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a conten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people seeking refu@@ ge in overwhel@@ med Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an event@@ ual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120@@ ,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angel@@ a Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighb@@ ors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ z@@ or @-@ wire f@@ ence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ m@@ ates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ z@@ or wire f@@ ence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Vi@@ ktor Or@@ ban , however , has insi@@ sted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view shar@@ ply at od@@ ds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @-@ meter ( 13 @-@ foot ) ra@@ z@@ or @-@ wire f@@ ence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government decla@@ res a state of crisis , &quot; government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of S@@ ze@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ por@@ ters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , hom@@ eland security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the f@@ ence , are now in police cu@@ sto@@ dy and are being charged with commit@@ ting off@@ enses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly re@@ pa@@ iring the f@@ ence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border cro@@ s@@ sin@@ gs with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with ra@@ z@@ or wire to close one of them .
cha@@ os envelop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ro@@ sz@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crow@@ ds pressed to squ@@ ee@@ ze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were ref@@ using food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders cut by half in national po@@ ll
former Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nom@@ ination nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while S@@ anders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have nar@@ ro@@ wed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and S@@ anders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and she and S@@ anders are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders by double @-@ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nation@@ wide say they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nom@@ ine@@ e .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nom@@ ine@@ e .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusi@@ astic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusias@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republi@@ can voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nom@@ ine@@ e , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also c@@ ited .
as the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jum@@ p in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nom@@ ination , Bi@@ den is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Bi@@ den would be their second choice , far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den choo@@ ses not to run for the Democratic nom@@ ination , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ anders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nom@@ ine@@ e , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nom@@ ine@@ e to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den does the best of the three on honest@@ y , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as in line with their views ide@@ olo@@ gically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions continue about H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email contro@@ vers@@ y has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
six@@ ty @-@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nation@@ wide don &apos;t see Trump as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy either .
both Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honest@@ y .
more see S@@ anders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 35@@ 1 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Trump in national po@@ ll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest C@@ BS News / New York Times po@@ ll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new po@@ ll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a foo@@ th@@ old
Republi@@ can voters nation@@ wide continue to back Trump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last C@@ BS po@@ ll , conducted before the Fo@@ x News debate last month , to 27 % in the po@@ ll out Tuesday .
but Car@@ son ro@@ ck@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Trump among college @-@ educated Republi@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o G@@ ov@@ . John Ka@@ sich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ consi@@ n G@@ ov@@ . Scott Wal@@ ker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida G@@ ov@@ . Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as G@@ ov@@ . Mi@@ ke Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ . Marco Ru@@ bio all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 37@@ 6 @-@ person sample of Republi@@ can voters in this newest po@@ ll is plus @-@ or @-@ min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted Sep@@ t .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the poll@@ s -- landing at 19 % support among Re@@ public@@ ans , behind Trump &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest po@@ ll from AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Trump took some pot@@ shots at the reti@@ red neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ zed for ques@@ tioning Trump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ o@@ wa .
pleasant temperatures for bathing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water .
a di@@ p in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German met@@ e@@ or@@ ological office ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
the Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for bathing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five f@@ rat@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ u@@ ch College fresh@@ man
nearly two years after a college student died during a f@@ rat@@ ernity ha@@ zing rit@@ ual in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ u@@ ch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si f@@ rat@@ ernity brut@@ ally ass@@ aul@@ ted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation rit@@ e in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , sad@@ d@@ led with a 30 @-@ po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined that his head h@@ urt then fell un@@ conscious .
PI Delta P@@ si f@@ rat@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Den@@ g passed out , and alle@@ ge@@ dly wa@@ ited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Den@@ g &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact An@@ dy Men@@ g , the f@@ rat@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the f@@ rat@@ ernity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief Wag@@ ner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning .
according to an au@@ top@@ s@@ y report , Den@@ g was subjected to repeated bl@@ unt force trau@@ ma to his head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ gh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been dev@@ ast@@ ated as a result of f@@ rat@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , &quot; Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Den@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two other f@@ rat@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with ass@@ ault ha@@ zing and criminal con@@ spi@@ racy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanc@@ tioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; Wag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ u@@ ch College banned the f@@ rat@@ ernity and the national f@@ rat@@ ernity rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hi@@ ke will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yiel@@ ds will clim@@ b and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigor@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tra@@ jec@@ tory of how long it will take to normali@@ ze .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hi@@ ke f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
&quot; the first hi@@ ke from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Ju@@ lian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief global econom@@ ist at Capital Econom@@ ics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip@@ ation of rate hi@@ kes can make things vol@@ atile for a while .
once the hi@@ ke h@@ its , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to st@@ all 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hi@@ ke , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank an@@ al@@ yst@@ s said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hi@@ kes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up shar@@ ply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hi@@ ke , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bo@@ b Dol@@ l , chief equity strate@@ g@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks ten@@ ds to get more pron@@ ounced later in the rate @-@ hiking cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hi@@ kes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hi@@ ke .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hi@@ kes since 1950 , only twice has nomin@@ al year over year GDP been below 4.@@ 5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlan@@ ta Fed .
hiking rates into such a fragile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hi@@ ke all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and economists believe the F@@ OM@@ C could approve a hi@@ ke at this meeting , fut@@ ures trading indicates just a 25 percent prob@@ ability .
&quot; in our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ ession pe@@ aks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the lon@@ gest the Fed has wa@@ ited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been vol@@ atile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hi@@ ke , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equi@@ ties experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yiel@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke / cut in the cycle arri@@ ves .
at the end of the hiking cycle bond yiel@@ ds fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strate@@ gi@@ sts believe the hi@@ ke in rates will cause yiel@@ ds between lon@@ ger@@ - and shorter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the cur@@ ve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cau@@ tious about stret@@ ching for yield , &quot; K@@ ath@@ y J@@ ones , fixed income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , J@@ ones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of ti@@ ghter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit spre@@ ads have wi@@ dened and vol@@ atility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; history shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hi@@ ke , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ al@@ yst@@ s said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets out@@ pac@@ ed weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hi@@ kes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low vol@@ atility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yiel@@ ds at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
B@@ BC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic F@@ M says MP Andre@@ w B@@ ingham
conservative MP Andre@@ w B@@ ingham critic@@ ised station for &apos; du@@ mb@@ ing down@@ &apos;
argu@@ es it &apos;s becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from commercial rival
also took aim at the B@@ BC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins MP attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
B@@ BC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Classic F@@ M , a leading MP has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that it does something that commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
conservative MP Andre@@ w B@@ ingham also told B@@ BC bo@@ sses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from its commercial rival .
&quot; radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic F@@ M , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the B@@ BC Music Awards , launched last December .
the B@@ BC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just m@@ im@@ i@@ cking what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
B@@ BC director general denied the charges , argu@@ ing that B@@ BC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commission@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , B@@ BC Radio 3 controller Al@@ an Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audi@@ ences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the B@@ BC &apos;s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial ri@@ vals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Vo@@ ice - the musical talent show which the B@@ BC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ om@@ a Fa@@ ith and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly B@@ BC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending licence fee pa@@ yers &apos; money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bol@@ stered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; An@@ dy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
he explained that online sales were bol@@ stered three years ago when sh@@ opp@@ ers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different con@@ texts , such as on the sofa .
but now that is pl@@ ate@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being c@@ ited as one of the reasons behind the s@@ lowing sales .
experts believe sh@@ opp@@ ers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of sh@@ opp@@ ers flo@@ cked to their computers to s@@ na@@ p up deals cra@@ shing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw sh@@ opp@@ ers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding sh@@ opp@@ ers off from making purchases
research published by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .

Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry , new chief executive of King@@ fis@@ her , which own@@ s the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock @-@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q out@@ lets .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the hel@@ m of Britain &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restruc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fis@@ her posted a fall in both half @-@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting stores .
as a result of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , which own@@ s Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
officials from A@@ ich @-@ D@@ ob in court for breach of trust
two officials from the Austrian vol@@ ley@@ ball run@@ ner @-@ up champi@@ on team A@@ ich @-@ D@@ ob attended the Kla@@ gen@@ fur@@ t regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax ev@@ asion .
the defen@@ dants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
he was legally acqu@@ it@@ ted of this charge in May .
the current case was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to senior Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defen@@ dants used mon@@ ies from the club &apos;s accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
the loss is estimated at around € 400@@ ,000 .
the sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
the Chair@@ woman of the La@@ y Ju@@ dge Sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postp@@ oned .
it will be tried at a later date .
on the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
the sports officials had only offset expense allowances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - li@@ abilities in 2001 amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 44@@ ,000 ) .
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , &quot; said one of the defen@@ dents , who makes his living as an audi@@ tor of large companies for the tax authorities .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we advanced money and deposi@@ ted our life insurance policies with the bank as security , &quot; he said during the examination .
it was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spective payment of the expense allow@@ ance back to 1991 was agreed .
as a result , a part of the expense allow@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
this is why general and not detailed deb@@ it entries appeared , was the former chairman &apos;s explanation for the processes .
the two defen@@ dants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
the Ju@@ dge asked why the payments had not been dis@@ closed to the club in detail .
the club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
when investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred into the club &apos;s account .
those were reserves , explained the def@@ end@@ ant .
this securities account was run in the name of the two defen@@ dants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
&quot; why ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge wanted to know .
there was no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor put to the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant knew about it , the official justified himself .
the purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
&quot; why compensation for damages ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge and the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor wanted to know .
in response , the first def@@ end@@ ant said that he had dis@@ agreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
but what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; This lets us all off the ho@@ ok &quot; ?
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
the official carried on that he had never received a cent in sal@@ ary , he had only charged for mile@@ age and a per di@@ em allow@@ ance .
the club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allowances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
the defen@@ dants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
this was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
the second def@@ end@@ ant had also obtained a mile@@ age allow@@ ance .
all adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in Völ@@ ker@@ markt to the bank in B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witn@@ esses .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard cutting a further 3@@ 0,000 jobs
in addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the sp@@ lit@@ ting of the company .
there seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25@@ ,000 and 3@@ 0,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
this should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company dis@@ closed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a one @-@ off charge of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2@@ ,000 staff .
at the end of trading He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent .
the group based in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , California , which initially grew through its printer sales , is currently sp@@ lit@@ ting its business : this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
repeatedly dis@@ appointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently aff@@ lic@@ ted the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo .
in the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and pr@@ inters fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
this means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive la@@ yo@@ ffs .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old business headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying sm@@ art@@ phones and tab@@ lets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s plans for restructuring include around 55@@ ,000 job losses .
conflicts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
the majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
six@@ ty @-@ one percent re@@ acted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
twenty @-@ four percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict .
fifty @-@ one percent of those surve@@ yed are against cooperating with the Syrian rul@@ er Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , but 20 percent were in favour .
twenty @-@ nine percent were un@@ decided .
cars : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IA@@ A

the general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organis@@ ers from the automobile Association V@@ DA estimate that approximately 9@@ 00@@ ,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used te@@ ar gas and water c@@ ann@@ ons against several hundred an@@ gr@@ y refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water c@@ ann@@ on stood at the ready .
between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sti@@ cks and plastic bot@@ tles at the officers .
at first the officers used a continuous spra@@ y of p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
then the police used te@@ ar gas .
a lot of te@@ ar gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
this caused the group to break up .
the group has now reluc@@ t@@ antly withdrawn .
a pregn@@ ant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
children who have inhal@@ ed te@@ ar gas are scre@@ aming .
other refugees have s@@ lum@@ ped down together and are suffering from resp@@ ir@@ atory di@@ stress .
the press spokes@@ man for the Serbian police also sustained in@@ juries from the use of te@@ ar gas and p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists poll@@ ed by Re@@ u@@ ters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are appro@@ aching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normali@@ zation of interest rates , &quot; said An@@ gel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trilli@@ ons of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ s@@ y global outlook .
it has war@@ ned markets to be ready for a hi@@ ke but indications are they also believe the od@@ ds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .00 C@@ ET on Thursday .
Delta State University sho@@ oter left note of apo@@ lo@@ gy
after shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ . said Lam@@ b , a geogra@@ phy and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to b@@ other anyone &quot; but is likely up@@ set .
police asked the call@@ er his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , Lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , a history prof@@ essor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b alle@@ ge@@ dly believed Pr@@ enti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmi@@ dt , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love tri@@ angle . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
Kno@@ w@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a ho@@ und dog named Li@@ gh@@ tn@@ ing , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said .
police said Lam@@ b had ph@@ oned rel@@ atives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to j@@ ail . &quot;
when c@@ ops caught up with him on High@@ way 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pul@@ led his car over , ba@@ iled out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ w@@ ings : Lufthansa re@@ construc@@ ting group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
the Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pil@@ ots &apos; union .
Lufthansa is re@@ organising the structure of its business and upgrading its low @-@ cost subsidiary Euro@@ w@@ ings .
the goal of the reali@@ gn@@ ment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
the Euro@@ w@@ ings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
in the future , Karl Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ w@@ ings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with this new reali@@ gn@@ ment Spo@@ hr underlines the importance of Euro@@ w@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and E@@ asy@@ jet in the future .
up to now the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been extremely complex .
the airline is consoli@@ dating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrel@@ la .
new negotiations with pil@@ ots
following the strike which was hal@@ ted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pil@@ ots &apos; union Cock@@ pit ( VC ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
this was announced by the union .
under discussion will be the pil@@ ots &apos; retirement scheme .
&quot; in a year with record results predic@@ ted &quot; Cock@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
the conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
besides the pil@@ ots &apos; transitional pension payments , the background is the &quot; W@@ ings &quot; budget concept .
it proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa out@@ sources to the group &apos;s own budget airline , Euro@@ w@@ ings .

Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double fra@@ c@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ c@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champi@@ ons League defeat at P@@ SV Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this left the full @-@ back in te@@ ars and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hope@@ ful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had bur@@ st into the P@@ SV area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pit@@ ch and required ox@@ y@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ c@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically and then this happens .
when it was in the dre@@ ssing room he had an ox@@ y@@ gen m@@ ask on .
he was cr@@ ying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fra@@ c@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the conc@@ ession of a spot @-@ k@@ ick .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alise the Mexi@@ can .
van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two leg@@ s .
a t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;

the England def@@ ender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the P@@ SV coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to in@@ j@@ ure an oppon@@ ent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to in@@ j@@ ure the oppon@@ ent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
speaking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ SV &apos;s Andr@@ és Guar@@ da@@ do was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cam@@ eron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lo@@ ves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cam@@ eron .
asked by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cam@@ eron writ@@ es in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : &quot; fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
all very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cam@@ eron sup@@ pos@@ edly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pré@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to p@@ ad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; set in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 .
if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough , Cam@@ eron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Mo@@ vie Dat@@ ab@@ ase website , which begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y . &quot;
given he is an avo@@ w@@ edly hands @-@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cam@@ eron is so un@@ familiar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy he@@ ars how the local environment was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the av@@ ari@@ cious , tree @-@ ch@@ opping , th@@ need @-@ k@@ nit@@ ting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , m@@ ou@@ st@@ ach@@ io@@ ed creature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sour@@ ced to an ai@@ de , se@@ em@@ ingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cam@@ eron &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cam@@ eron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ is@@ sion but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates is a tough assign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ sta@@ ir C@@ ook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting lin@@ eu@@ p and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful posi@@ tivity .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an att@@ acking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ ales
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ shire .
his seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but har@@ sh reality is that cri@@ ck@@ eters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe R@@ oot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own dest@@ iny .
hopefully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , pra@@ ised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a Test b@@ ats@@ man gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like S@@ am Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wa@@ sted opportunity is in the past now .
Ale@@ x H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I rate highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ eter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ shire saw early this season when he made 23@@ 6 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge pit@@ ch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be afford@@ ed the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
the idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside C@@ ook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four Qui@@ cks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ kem@@ aker cannot bat there and this left @-@ han@@ der has already shown he is one hell of a cri@@ ck@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his coun@@ ty , Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 Tests at first drop before step@@ ping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ inn@@ ers putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ aching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri Lanka b@@ ats@@ man , as a consul@@ tant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stro@@ ke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lo@@ ve@@ liest blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less stre@@ ak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cri@@ cket , be it playing or co@@ aching , and like Mah@@ ela has nous that can be ta@@ pped .
sometimes new voices in the dre@@ ssing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fresh@@ en up a side .
col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham team @-@ mate Ben St@@ ok@@ es is re@@ sted for the one @-@ da@@ yers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken ligh@@ tly .

a European diplom@@ at ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self @-@ absor@@ bed agenda of divi@@ sive concessions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they ero@@ ded social protection .
we could even call it Da@@ ve and George &apos;s sel@@ fi@@ e agenda .
pm and chan@@ cell@@ or rock up to summ@@ its or bilateral sessions in foreign cap@@ itals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monu@@ ment , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European p@@ al , who wants an out@@ ward @-@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some cap@@ itals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angel@@ a Merkel , Germany &apos;s cau@@ ti@@ ously level @-@ headed chan@@ cell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ sta@@ yers Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hol@@ lan@@ de is facing re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tenden@@ cies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , SN@@ P @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s 2017 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my p@@ al suggests .
&quot; the rene@@ goti@@ ation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the rene@@ goti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU @-@ scep@@ tic the oli@@ gar@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may di@@ mly remember Bor@@ is John@@ son , the arch Euro @-@ opport@@ un@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight bananas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness E@@ d Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ sh@@ y ra@@ sc@@ als , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreign@@ ers and p@@ seu@@ do non @-@ D@@ OM@@ s who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the bananas to di@@ stra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in op@@ posing Cam@@ eron &apos;s referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conc@@ eded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting N@@ eil Kinnock &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andre@@ w Mar@@ r whose B@@ BC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evol@@ ving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside UK@@ IP &apos;s wo@@ ad @-@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der sho@@ res of T@@ ory little En@@ gl@@ ander@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him stru@@ gg@@ led not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old dad stru@@ gg@@ led on TV to be dis@@ lo@@ yal to Labour cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MP@@ s at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , tou@@ chy @-@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cam@@ eron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell has said .
Simon Jen@@ k@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ voc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their B@@ enn@@ ite sie@@ ge economy , anti @-@ capitali@@ st past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ ftw@@ ing dis@@ siden@@ ts for whom the nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ sm of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doc@@ trin@@ al squ@@ ab@@ bles .
as with his equi@@ voc@@ ation over Nat@@ o - Tom Watson is ad@@ am@@ ant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to qu@@ it - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspi@@ cious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be poin@@ tless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ eb@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking aro@@ se from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lan@@ c@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( phe ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
phe published the &quot; land@@ mark &quot; report last month , descri@@ bing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have ques@@ tioned the robu@@ st@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an edi@@ torial in the Lan@@ c@@ et medical jour@@ nal last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily fli@@ ms@@ y foundation &quot; on which phe based its main conclusion .
writing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have ques@@ tioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , prof@@ essor of European public health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medi@@ cine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , prof@@ essor of clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect phe &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ C@@ DA ) model to syn@@ the@@ si@@ se their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spons@@ or of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
he also endorsed B@@ AT &apos;s public health cre@@ denti@@ als in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigare@@ tte manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the ration@@ ale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigare@@ tte champi@@ ons , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; t@@ ell@@ ingly conc@@ edes &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the phe report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said phe &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were pre@@ mature .
pro@@ f K@@ ev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well@@ being at phe , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lifelong smo@@ kers dies from their addi@@ ction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ HS £ 2@@ bn a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a fra@@ ction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .
B@@ BC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former Channel 4 chief
the former Channel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke John@@ son has said the B@@ BC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
John@@ son said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the B@@ BC for putting public service programmes likely to be wat@@ ched by a smaller audience in tough s@@ lots against its ri@@ vals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the B@@ BC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the cor@@ poration wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , John@@ son said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie @-@ up with the B@@ BC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the B@@ BC c@@ ommis@@ sions and broad@@ casts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; John@@ son told the House of L@@ ords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the B@@ BC .
if you keep the licence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commission@@ ing .
they broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime s@@ lot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
John@@ son said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a re@@ gressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Vo@@ ice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly made in @-@ house .
frank@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would dimin@@ ish the B@@ BC at all .
John@@ son , a serial entre@@ pren@@ eur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the B@@ BC was guilty of ch@@ asing rat@@ ings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the B@@ BC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lec@@ ture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the B@@ BC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
John@@ son said the B@@ BC &apos;s more ni@@ che public service programmes &quot; go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about justi@@ fying £ 4@@ bn in licence fee income , &quot; W@@ ell of course , we do all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one wat@@ ched . &quot;
they put them on a s@@ lot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the licence fee , John@@ son told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don &apos;t consu@@ me a lot of the B@@ BC .
former Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the B@@ BC should rev@@ ise its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said little of the B@@ BC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and change it to &quot; inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the B@@ BC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a hand@@ ful were shown on TV , and enter into alli@@ ances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses .
scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with genetically modified ner@@ vous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high @-@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
the pul@@ ses work by swit@@ ching on motor ne@@ ur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry mem@@ bran@@ e channels that respond to ultra@@ son@@ ic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , du@@ b@@ bed son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultra@@ sound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , a re@@ sear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an that the procedure could one day replace deep @-@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ a@@ sive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s bra@@ ins to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
ne@@ mat@@ ode wor@@ ms do not usually react to ultra@@ sound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id containing micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found , amp@@ li@@ fy the ultra@@ son@@ ic waves which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
the amp@@ li@@ fied ultra@@ sound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 i@@ on channels , found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms &quot; cells .
the sound waves make these i@@ on channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
to make ultra@@ sound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their motor ne@@ ur@@ ons carried TR@@ P @-@ 4 i@@ on channels .
when he applied ultra@@ sound to the modified cre@@ atures , the sound waves were amp@@ li@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they swit@@ ched on the modified motor ne@@ ur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch ne@@ ur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ bre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultra@@ sound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human ne@@ ur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultra@@ sound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and insu@@ lin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student h@@ alls
it &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student h@@ alls as an obli@@ vi@@ ous 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still belie@@ ving in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ativ@@ ism , but it &apos;s only now I recall the stra@@ ined sm@@ iles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
moving into h@@ alls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve @-@ ra@@ cking to totally terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honest@@ ly neither love nor h@@ ate Mar@@ mit@@ e because seriously gu@@ ys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extrac@@ t ha@@ ha@@ ha I &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;

give people space .
people &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks recep@@ tions , movie @-@ night venues and commun@@ al han@@ g@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dre@@ ssed and adjust their under@@ wear .

intro@@ ver@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a re@@ treat , yet many h@@ alls form an inter @-@ room @-@ stro@@ lling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to lifelong friend@@ ships .
that can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friend@@ ship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve exp@@ ended on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhau@@ sted from soci@@ alising - and maybe text instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
one guy in my student h@@ alls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .

since you &apos;re starting un@@ i at the height of Ba@@ ke @-@ O@@ ff man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es seems margin@@ ally less wei@@ rd , less 195@@ 0s &quot; Wel@@ come to the neighbourhood , I bak@@ ed you something , now s@@ mile as I ask you personal questions . &quot;

double check with the milk owner .
chances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re se@@ e@@ thing inside .

she &apos;s in j@@ ail now .
you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
this isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al people in glass houses .
a girl on my corri@@ dor asked her neighb@@ our if they w@@ ouldn &apos;t mind turning down the dru@@ m and b@@ ass because it was 3@@ am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .

when they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ dly let them sleep for two hours before b@@ lasting her own music , lo@@ cking her door as she left for her three @-@ hour ex@@ am .

of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot h@@ all@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .

ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low ear@@ ners
property entre@@ pren@@ eur Mark@@ us Gil@@ dner is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses in the Middle Fran@@ con@@ ian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
for example for refugees - but also as a sign : &quot; not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . &quot;
&quot; I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
entre@@ pren@@ eur Mar@@ cus Gil@@ dner believes he knows how quickly economical housing can be developed : with this project he is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
what solution are you offering ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms is not sustainable .
because most of the people will be staying here .
we will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influ@@ x of refugees over the next decades .
a totally standard three @-@ sto@@ rey ter@@ ra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs little space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
it is different when the people are hous@@ ed in blocks of flat@@ s .
each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
each living unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
it &apos;s possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I &apos;m going back .
then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4@@ ,000 without land .
that is manage@@ able .
construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
did building regulations complic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
the s@@ word of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
sc@@ ary .
it is still assumed that anyone creating three flat@@ s in a ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs at least three parking places .
except that there is not enough space in towns .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how have residents re@@ acted to your ter@@ ra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
that is definitely not true .
but aren &apos;t you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ dner : the truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly any@@ body can afford any longer .
my project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays .
this is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by heading to the Sett@@ ings app , ta@@ pping &quot; General , &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that &quot; Software update failed . &quot;
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the r@@ ush to die down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ Tun@@ es .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
that might include del@@ eting app@@ s to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by sli@@ mming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest app@@ s to delete and then re @-@ install them once the process is over .
it &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the update happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of battery .
if the charge is too low , Apple won &apos;t let the update go ahead , since the phone dying hal@@ f@@ way through could lead to the update breaking .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only mot@@ to : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one mot@@ to in his fight for the Formul@@ a One world champi@@ onship title against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ am@@ mate Le@@ wis Ham@@ il@@ ton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
the world champi@@ onship run@@ ner @-@ up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races &quot; that I &apos;ve got nothing more to lose . &quot;
before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divide the vice world champi@@ on from the ti@@ t@@ le@@ holder and two times champi@@ on Ham@@ il@@ ton .
the Bri@@ t has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floo@@ d@@ lit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite .
in 2009 and in the prec@@ eding year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet un@@ clear .
a p@@ all of smo@@ g has been han@@ ging over the city for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ at@@ ra .
bad K@@ is@@ singer ch@@ ess club has a prominent member
the &quot; Ch@@ ess friends of Bad K@@ is@@ sin@@ gen &quot; ch@@ ess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is business@@ man Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passion@@ ate ch@@ ess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad K@@ is@@ sin@@ gen more than 40 times for spa treatments .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and is a fre@@ em@@ an of the towns of E@@ sp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the ch@@ ess club in Bad K@@ is@@ sin@@ gen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Al@@ fred Kl@@ ein .
this makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
youth work and talent sear@@ ches can also be pursued .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants his membership of the ch@@ ess club as well as his friendly contact with the &quot; Red @-@ white &quot; tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town .
accommodation office seeks face @-@ to @-@ face contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the man@@ tle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Gra@@ f @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
the social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
more precisely , to Gra@@ f @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new accommodation office will be opening there shortly .
here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nur@@ sing insurance or the services of nur@@ sing and health insurance companies .
with our out@@ patient care service we have for years realised that family care@@ gi@@ vers are often left alone .
this raises numerous questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently , too , many services provided by insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , &quot; the new manager , J@@ ut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people &apos;s welfare is also responsible for the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft and the b@@ ür@@ ger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; out@@ patient services , explained .
apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and wellness .
Sal@@ u@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
as a result , additional offer@@ ings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ otherap@@ y treatment are also available .
the offers from the senior citizens centre and from Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis represents prevention , precau@@ tion , and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior citizens &apos; centre for care and nur@@ sing , &quot; is how Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis describes it .
both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good decentrali@@ sed infrastructure in the individual districts of B@@ am@@ berg essential in the future .
furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang M@@ etz@@ ner ( SP@@ D ) underlined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . &quot; there are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend inv@@ it@@ ations to regular social gather@@ ings . &quot;
thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang dies at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday .
in Men@@ g the Künstler@@ haus has lost an hon@@ our@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; it is reported .

in the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury chamber in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ wi@@ tz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

men set upon 17 @-@ year @-@ old af@@ gan
police are seeking witn@@ esses to an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster . at about 11.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
according to police one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
at this point the group were level with the b@@ ft petrol station .
three people were standing on the petrol station premises .
one of these men sh@@ ou@@ ted at the youth and hit him in the face with his f@@ ist .

Dr Frank Müller takes over Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10,000
Sy@@ l@@ via Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over practice from Karl @-@ Hein@@ rich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen .
the may@@ or of the joint community , Ber@@ nd Bor@@ mann , business spons@@ or U@@ ta Se@@ Im @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dorf &apos;s may@@ or Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are delighted at this turn of events .
many areas in the country have no doctor - A@@ sen@@ dorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Hein@@ rich will spend the next few months working part @-@ time with his successor .
Dr Müller re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Sil@@ via Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the time were finishing their residen@@ cies in Ver@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
&quot; it was always in the back of our minds that the Mü@@ ll@@ ers would fit into this practice well , &quot; says Dr Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen and lau@@ gh@@ s .
&quot; when we were ready , I simply called them up . &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know the families and support them over the years . &quot;
he also sees being his own bo@@ ss as a benefit .
and so it was agreed that the Mü@@ ll@@ ers would buy the house with the practice .
however in the meantime they are living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg und Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a consul@@ tant in Sul@@ ingen , furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the coun@@ ty of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new bo@@ ss .
while sur@@ ge@@ on Dr Karl @-@ Hein@@ rich Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen worked as a general practi@@ tion@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel ( a specialist in internal medicine ) specialised in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ ll@@ ers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practi@@ tion@@ ers .
&quot; so it &apos;s out with the endo@@ scop@@ y , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Sy@@ l@@ via Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultra@@ sound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and we need one more consulting room .
the IT system will also be completely renewed .
the Mü@@ ll@@ ers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 5@@ 0,000 as part of a funding programme from the coun@@ ty ( € 2,@@ 500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 12,@@ 500 ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , &quot; stressed the may@@ or of the joint community Ber@@ nd Bor@@ mann .
according to Sy@@ l@@ via Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , some 2@@ ,000 patients visit the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen , the chem@@ ist will stay in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t found any successor , it would have closed down .
anyone visiting the Mü@@ ll@@ ers &apos; surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assi@@ stants and the clean@@ er from the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens .
with their leaving , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
&quot; we started with only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen with a gr@@ in .
after such a long time she feels a little wi@@ st@@ ful .
&quot; but we &apos;ll still be living in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and I &apos;m sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , &quot; says the internal medicine specialist .
her husband adds with a s@@ mile , &quot; We &apos;ve got a 6@@ 000 m ² garden . &quot;
&quot; up to now I haven &apos;t done much gar@@ dening , that might change now . &quot;
the couple also have two grand@@ children and enjoy travelling .
Croatia : &quot; we are let@@ ting the refugees through &quot;
&quot; border control is being brought in now on our southern border too , &quot; says Interior Minister Johann@@ a Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
in parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
it is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can &quot; of course &quot; do so .
the care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
it is equally clear &quot; that obvious signals are needed , &quot; says the minister .
people must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border either .
a controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a &quot; corri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia has refused .
the Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corri@@ dors for the refugees .
however , Interior Minister V@@ es@@ na G@@ Y@@ Ö@@ R@@ K@@ Ö@@ S Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach did not see it in quite the same light .
the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slov@@ ein@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
the border with Croatia , as the external border to the Schengen area , is however already heavily controlled .
but as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not sugge@@ sting se@@ aling its borders for refugees .
&quot; every member of the EU has to ful@@ fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed G@@ Y@@ Ö@@ R@@ K@@ Ö@@ S Z@@ ni@@ dar .
according to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the To@@ var@@ nik / Si@@ d border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize field .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian T@@ av@@ ar@@ nik .
they are mostly Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
the emergency se@@ vices and the Red Cross are also already in place .
interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expec@@ ting around 4000 refugees in the next few days .
in addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diver@@ ted to Croatia
the government in Bel@@ grade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . &quot; we neither can nor want to do that , &quot; they stated .
according to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the de@@ tain@@ ees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Maced@@ onian border , about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to go through Croatia , Slo@@ wen@@ i@@ a and Austria to get to Germany .
this implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predic@@ ted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : &quot; widespread options for border control &quot;
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influ@@ x of refugees .
he gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non @-@ member of the Schengen Treaty , has &quot; widespread options for border control . &quot;
rigorous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ e@@ gen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
there are also some 300 refugees stu@@ ck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border f@@ ence .
according to media reports from Bel@@ grade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the Hungarian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cro@@ s@@ sin@@ gs also remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
at a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Ste@@ fan@@ o@@ vic , tried to re@@ assure people : he considers the debate on the refugees &apos; alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be pre@@ mature .
at the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
it is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers has been sent to the border region .

&quot; current information indicates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught , &quot; an S@@ EC report states .

Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care celeb@@ rates 20 years in Mann@@ heim
business rules around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mann@@ heim
people carry out their err@@ ands , some of them walking br@@ is@@ k@@ ly , some of them stro@@ lling along in a lei@@ surely fashion .
they head for the two branches of the Mann@@ heim car show@@ room .
tra@@ ms stop .
pul@@ sing , vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sun@@ shine , and right in the middle are four big black@@ boards each bearing the words , &quot; Be@@ fore I die I want to ... &quot;
the Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is encounter@@ ing extremely mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the head of Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with pas@@ sers @-@ by , as are voluntary workers .
while many pas@@ sers @-@ by impul@@ sively gra@@ b the chal@@ k and complete the sentence with &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; be able to read , &quot; &quot; drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for long , &quot; others stop briefly , read , say things like &quot; I &apos;m not ready for that yet , &quot; and carry on .
again and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also there now .
&quot; it &apos;s only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live respon@@ sibly , &quot; says the Director of the Prote@@ stant social char@@ ity Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ischen Werk in Mann@@ heim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ it@@ as Association for Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care .
which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old organisation .
of course it &apos;s understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it &apos;s a very personal matter .
the topics of life and death are still ste@@ ep@@ ed in tab@@ oos , according to Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
a perception shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the volunte@@ er worker , who helps people to deal with death and grie@@ f , has been with the organisation from the start .
having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
when the Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation appe@@ aled for volunte@@ er hel@@ pers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunte@@ ers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their rel@@ atives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the San@@ kt Vinc@@ ent Hosp@@ ice .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it entails .
&quot; I see life from a different point of view , I believe it is precious and I sei@@ ze the moment , &quot; she says .
the out@@ patient services offered by the Ecu@@ men@@ ical Hosp@@ ice organisation are free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ation@@ ally independent .
financial support from health insurance companies and don@@ ations by members enable education as well as training sessions , and training and supervision for pal@@ li@@ ative care providers and grie@@ f coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors .
training for new staff is offered every two years .
the black@@ boards , with the messages written on them on Saturday , are now on display in the Ev@@ ange@@ li@@ cal church ( M@@ 1 , 1@@ a ) and the Catholic church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on post@@ cards there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex earnings mixed , lo@@ wers fiscal 2016 outlook
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full @-@ year profit forecast on weak@@ er demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced it would hire 5@@ 0,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening b@@ ell .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier pre@@ diction .
an@@ al@@ yst@@ s expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hi@@ kes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost @-@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was &quot; performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er @-@ than @-@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the holiday @-@ hi@@ ring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ ,000 extra workers , about the same that it hi@@ red last year .
in the quarter that ended Aug@@ . 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 an@@ al@@ yst@@ s surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six an@@ al@@ yst@@ s surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Gro@@ und .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening b@@ ell , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 27 @-@ foot Hon@@ dur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s or@@ n@@ ate , two @-@ story bo@@ ard@@ room will be a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a remin@@ der that Fed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great Rec@@ ession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a too @-@ close @-@ to @-@ predic@@ t decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could make already @-@ cau@@ tious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the vol@@ atility by raising their bench@@ mark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. P@@ ie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market@@ place is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of economists surve@@ yed recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg predic@@ ted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expec@@ ting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to so@@ ften the b@@ low by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow J@@ ones industrial average jum@@ ped 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the rally was trig@@ gered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
&quot; it would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
if Fed policymakers did , &quot; they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation s@@ lowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of pi@@ cking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of shar@@ ply lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , &quot; said I@@ an Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow J@@ ones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors fe@@ ared a s@@ lowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has re@@ bo@@ unded somewhat this month , with the D@@ ow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed policymakers , the market tur@@ mo@@ il adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tigh@@ tening at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ er , a senior research fellow at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real E@@ state and a former Fed official .
now , he predic@@ ts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @-@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ lin@@ er said .
the health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hin@@ t by then @-@ Chairman Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot; ta@@ per &quot; its monetary expansion trig@@ gered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central ban@@ kers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @-@ making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth @-@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
J@@ eff@@ rey L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , V@@ a . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ re@@ acting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the policy@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , c@@ ited decisions in 1998 @-@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its bench@@ mark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U.S. growth , &quot; L@@ ack@@ er said .
a year later , Fed officials rever@@ sed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market mel@@ t@@ down , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rate @-@ setting committee .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being sc@@ ared of a rate hi@@ ke because markets got up@@ set , &quot; said Po@@ sen , president of the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / ware@@ house opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
frequently referred to as the Thai Co@@ st@@ co , LA@@ X @-@ C is a wholesale Thai market that also s@@ ells to the public .
yes , it &apos;s in Chin@@ at@@ own and not Thai Town .
the market / ware@@ house is a one @-@ stop shop , offering an di@@ zz@@ ying array of fresh , frozen and dri@@ ed goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and kitchen@@ ware , furniture , religious and holiday decor@@ ations .
there &apos;s even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil .
the store is massive , and it will take over an hour to com@@ b through all the a@@ is@@ les .
if all that shopping makes you hung@@ ry , gra@@ b a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BB@@ Q Express .
the store &apos;s indoor food st@@ all ( good , in@@ expensive ) is near the regi@@ sters , and has various ta@@ ke@@ out options .
what it stocks : need something - anything - Thai ?
la@@ x @-@ C probably has it .
items are reasonably priced , and a number of items are sold in bulk .
fresh produce includes speci@@ alty Asian and regional Thai her@@ bs , fruits and more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ let fish , and even f@@ ry it for you if you &apos;d like .
a good portion of the store is given over to the massive free@@ zer section , where you &apos;ll find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bit@@ ter mel@@ on and gal@@ an@@ gal , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and bile , por@@ k cas@@ ings , fish b@@ alls , regional s@@ aus@@ ages , commer@@ cially @-@ prepared foods and more .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
these days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who un@@ sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly support asylum seekers in the town .
among these are Pet@@ ra und Klaus H@@ eine .
Pet@@ ra H@@ eine is a dedicated teacher .
even at 74 she still lo@@ ves teaching .
every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Society of Rio Grande Pro@@ mot@@ es He@@ al@@ thy Bre@@ ast@@ feeding Die@@ ts
Brazilian pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS has come up with a sho@@ cking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ ast@@ feeding , by featuring images of bab@@ ies su@@ ck@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
human breast milk is composed of a variety of prot@@ eins , f@@ ats , vit@@ am@@ ins , and carb@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates , which give bab@@ ies all the nutri@@ ents they need to grow a strong imm@@ une system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregn@@ ant women and new m@@ oms are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a prof@@ essor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medi@@ cine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregn@@ ant women actually affected the genetic expression of their bab@@ ies and protected them from developing tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy di@@ ets were found to neg@@ atively affect the child &apos;s imm@@ une system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and it is making an exception .
the roof may be f@@ latter to accommodate a solar energy system .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
the committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an &quot; exception , &quot; or rather an &quot; exemption &quot; under building law to the applicable building plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
according to this a &quot; g@@ able roof with an off @-@ centre ri@@ dge and roof over@@ hang &quot; will be constructed .
the background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . &quot; this means we will have a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ facing roof , &quot; explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
the &quot; exemption &quot; on the other hand refers to the roof pit@@ ch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipul@@ ations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
this will reduce the volume of the hall .
therefore an &quot; exemption &quot; is necessary , since the development plan allows no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to roof pit@@ ch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemptions .
the sports hall is however more of a recur@@ ring project . &quot; we are not setting a prece@@ dent with this , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs have been calculated at around € 2.3 million .
contributions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
in the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 met@@ re hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg C@@ lini@@ c moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg Hosp@@ ital is closing earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hosp@@ ital .
the wards and the majority of employees are moving to Sch@@ on@@ gau from P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg .
this allows for the district &apos;s limited company hospital &apos;s surprising plans , confirms district administrator Andre@@ a Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss .
the Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
if these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg will remain in employment .
the vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the premises are available .
those employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ on@@ gau will be offered positions in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss .
employees have been informed about the plans .
the changes were trig@@ gered by the re@@ sign@@ ation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the Sch@@ on@@ gau clini@@ c since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
when the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss , the name of &quot; Fischer , &quot; who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau , was raised .
for the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital , these changes mean an &quot; upgrade &quot; and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss .
Fis@@ her is a specialist in car@@ di@@ ac pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ l@@ lat@@ ors .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) speciali@@ ses in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological dis@@ orders in its internal medicine department .
in the transi@@ tionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establishments , and in the next year the former min@@ ers &apos; hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
thus far the district has planned this for 201@@ 8 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is finished .
district administrator Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradic@@ ts ru@@ mo@@ urs that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Min@@ ers , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I can rule that out . &quot; what will happen to the building , Jo@@ chner @-@ Wei@@ ss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
at the moment a Car@@ it@@ as short @-@ term care facility and a day@@ time psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric facility are hous@@ ed there .
&quot; it &apos;s the best thing that could have happened for us ; we won &apos;t get this sort of opportunity again , &quot; says Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which has been accepted &quot; positively and with understanding &quot; by employees .
real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physi@@ cian do not really exist .
he was asked by his colleagues at Sch@@ on@@ gau to take over the post of medical director .
the Pi@@ essen@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ ball@@ ers of Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lö@@ wen are being challeng@@ ed this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischer H@@ C .

in the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at B@@ H@@ C and they have some ground to make up there .
two injured in hunting accident near P@@ rat@@ au
two trac@@ tor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the ma@@ ize har@@ vest on Tuesday after@@ no@@ o@@ on .
a number of hun@@ ts@@ men were in action on a cor@@ n field near P@@ rat@@ au ( Wit@@ ten@@ burg district ) during the har@@ vest , according to police .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from R@@ hin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ ine the victim of violent crime
a suspec@@ t has led the police to the body of a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from R@@ hin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
when ques@@ tioned the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to having killed the te@@ en@@ ager and thrown her body into a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
six@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old missing from R@@ hin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
the body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ er@@ slau@@ tern the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police reported on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old suspec@@ t , who conf@@ essed to the crime and led investig@@ ators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
in their search for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
inter@@ views with the missing girl &apos;s circle of friends and acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces ultimately resulted in 20 @-@ year @-@ old becoming a suspec@@ t .
the presu@@ med perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen , where the body was found .
under inter@@ ro@@ gation the arrested man conf@@ essed the police that he had killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and thrown her body in the can@@ al .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old will be brought before the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate on Wednesday ; investig@@ ators have reduced the charge to one of man@@ slau@@ ghter .
further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se
and more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the struggle for al@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
with the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crow@@ ding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ bur@@ dened .
they are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
to supply the demand for affordable homes , 400@@ ,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
this is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; federation of associations .
in comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
this amounts to a short@@ fall of 14@@ 0,000 homes .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation .
many then push onto the housing market and stand in long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of rental flat@@ s .
according to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as ten@@ ants .
the negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study points to significant fail@@ ings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
there is a current short@@ fall in urban areas of around 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 living units la@@ ments Mat@@ thias Gün@@ ther , author of the study .
this is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
due to the s@@ lum@@ p in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in &quot; Hotel M@@ ama . &quot;
in large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; alliance suggests a fresh start .
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
for example land transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for spon@@ sored housing temporarily suspended .
in addition , according to the association , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the Kf@@ W state bank &apos;s refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
on Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been requested .
the project may now even be step@@ ped up .
refugees have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put corri@@ dor in place
since Hungary has virtually stopped let@@ ting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
however the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corri@@ dor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corri@@ dor , &quot; said Croatian Minister for the Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the se@@ aling off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
five hundred people came over the border at To@@ var@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had c@@ ord@@ oned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redund@@ ant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
the Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explains , &quot; Th@@ ey may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
they are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighb@@ our Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived at the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and in tax@@ is .
immediately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees did not come across border f@@ ences .
the border stri@@ ps hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
it is now planned for min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers to quickly create a safe passage .
meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday police counted 3@@ 66 people that they had picked up .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,@@ 3@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy climbing and damaging the border f@@ ences as criminal offences .
this has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of S@@ ze@@ ged .
those convic@@ ted are threatened with sent@@ ences of up to five years and ex@@ tradition from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new &quot; transition zone &quot; set up at the border , almost all - 93 - at the biggest crossing at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
in practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
according to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is &quot; a safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers will be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by &quot; the transition zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers have begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they are collecting the rub@@ bis@@ h that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
crow@@ d barriers are being disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being re@@ built .
no one wants to talk about the goal of this re@@ building .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
according to the go@@ ver@@ ment , around 20@@ ,000 migrants are still in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
in Fre@@ il@@ ass@@ ing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drives &quot; str@@ anded people &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with su@@ it@@ cases , &quot; says Mayor of W@@ ern@@ stein A@@ lo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists who wanted to get to Passa@@ u by train .
because Germany had un@@ expec@@ tedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influ@@ x of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the str@@ anded people over the border to Passa@@ u .
before that we enter@@ tained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
we said at once that we would take them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
one man insi@@ sted on hand@@ ing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
&quot; we were very pleased about that , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the str@@ anded train passengers had changed trains in W@@ els on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passa@@ u after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
but the regional train was stopped before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , excursions over the border are generally very popular .
the Bridge Festival is a joint effort between W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bridge Festival Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an athle@@ tic two bridge walk the day before with their Bav@@ arian neighbours .
the fact that Vi@@ ktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypo@@ critical policies :
instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp by construc@@ ting structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s stance closer to an atmosphere of national soci@@ alism .
it is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ o@@ tic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
those who have f@@ led , too , must notice that the &quot; promised land &quot; which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
it will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the appro@@ aching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
there is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Kon@@ rad is looking for winter @-@ proof accommodation for 35@@ ,000
Kon@@ rad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian Kon@@ rad is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
the government has engaged the former powerful R@@ ai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen ban@@ ker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Kon@@ rad has already got to gri@@ ps with the cha@@ os in the Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen reception centre .
&quot; we no longer have any hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen , &quot; he reported on his first achievement .
and the accommodation of the 20@@ ,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great f@@ uss , said Kon@@ rad , pra@@ ising the organisational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a &quot; critical situation . &quot;
in total , Kon@@ rad estimates that accommodation for 8@@ 5@@ ,000 will be required in the current year .
in order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 35@@ ,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20@@ ,000 to be provided for by the states and 15@@ ,000 by the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can manage .
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; says Kon@@ rad .
he has already carried out talks with the State Govern@@ ors .
they have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
&quot; it is going well in Austria , &quot; says Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP mand@@ at@@ ary is assisting Kon@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ din@@ al Christop@@ h Schön@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
the asylum coordin@@ ator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F &quot; Hel@@ p the way we are &quot; campaign .
private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
it is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier yesterday cri@@ ti@@ si@@ sed the specifications for accommodation as &quot; too high . &quot;
in times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain hei@@ ghts for to@@ wel ra@@ ils or sizes of sky@@ lights .
&quot; emergency standards &quot; should apply for a limited period .
Kon@@ rad uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody re@@ adily tells un@@ tru@@ ths to my face
his most important weapon is the power of persu@@ asion .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier are not co@@ sting the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
the want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to set up a container on Ste@@ phan@@ splat@@ z as an office .
but apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Linz demanding a better allocation
for the time being the city of Linz is not planning to open new sports h@@ alls and other buildings such as the Ti@@ ps Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
at the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their su@@ it@@ ability .
the town chief is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
other districts should also make their own contributions .
SE@@ EH@@ OF@@ ER : &quot; borders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off &quot;
in a long telephone call with Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , State Govern@@ or Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
SE@@ EH@@ OF@@ ER has assured me that the German borders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off .
the on@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
however appropriate border controls do now exist .
there will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany .
those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ühr@@ inger once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
the fact that Austria is also now re@@ introducing controls at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of Germany &apos;s approach .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ tz industrial area is officially finished .
the publicly listed IT group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . it is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be r@@ ented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
&quot; in IT cle@@ ver heads are our raw material - and we must try to get them to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T bo@@ ss H@@ annes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up businesses in Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft , and also later acqu@@ iring these .
s &amp; T wants to collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours from the start - and Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
SM@@ T is investing € 1.@@ 7 million in the location and € 3.@@ 3 million is coming from Te@@ ch@@ centre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lin@@ tz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG to S &amp; T and Te@@ ch@@ centre for 60 years .
thirty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already r@@ ented out and there have been en@@ quiries about the other 40 percent .
owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni opens second business in the ar@@ c@@ ade .

the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propri@@ et@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ c@@ ade had to un@@ cerem@@ oni@@ ously postp@@ one this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she s@@ ells among other things bags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women &apos;s hand@@ bags ; pur@@ ses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop opened yesterday .
it has been converted over the last few weeks .
&quot; I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
crucial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in Bologna , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , &quot; said the mother of two dau@@ gh@@ ters , who herself has Italian roots .
bre@@ it got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
it suits me best if something emer@@ ges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
the expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any out@@ fit .
the bra@@ gg@@ art from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ ine anc@@ est@@ ors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
this characteristic also connec@@ ts many with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always the source of contro@@ vers@@ y .
whether he is expressing xen@@ opho@@ bic opinions , being ru@@ de to journalists or reve@@ aling gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a sti@@ r in the election campaign .
and comes out of it well .
this is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , from where the property billi@@ on@@ aire &apos;s grand@@ parents origin@@ ate .
the New Yor@@ ker with the b@@ low @-@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine route .
many in the village of 1,@@ 200 inhabitants are related to him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Trump , here in election campaign mode .
Sim@@ one Wen@@ del , a resident of K@@ all@@ stadt , has made a film about Trump .
and what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ stadt people they are not deeply impressed .
the native of K@@ all@@ stadt has made an am@@ using docu@@ mentary film about the place and its famous off@@ sho@@ ots , included in whom besides Trump are also the Hein@@ z ket@@ ch@@ up family .
Trump , who is not known for his mo@@ dest@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in &quot; K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not won over the people there .
there is indeed a certain respect for his family &apos;s achievements , but there also ten@@ ds to be a view that Trump &quot; is a bit of a big@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s nick@@ name in the region is , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; a di@@ al@@ ect term which transl@@ ates as &quot; The Bra@@ gg@@ art , &quot; she says .
Trump comes from the village of the bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
the story of the Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos; success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald Trump &apos;s grand@@ father emi@@ gr@@ ated and opened a s@@ alo@@ on for gold prospec@@ tors in the USA .
the foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
but his grand@@ parents &apos; lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collap@@ sed in the Bav@@ arian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then belon@@ ged .
they would not let Trump enter as he had originally left without authorisation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate History and Cultural An@@ thro@@ polo@@ gy , Rol@@ and Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Trump is the grand@@ son of &quot; illegal emi@@ grants . &quot;
this is at od@@ ds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his des@@ c@@ end@@ ant .
he has repeatedly spoken in dero@@ g@@ atory terms about Mexi@@ can immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; the f@@ uss he makes about it is not very nice , &quot; says Hans @-@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Trump ( &quot; My grand@@ mother was born a Trump , my grand@@ father was born a Hein@@ z &quot; ) .
the reti@@ red win@@ em@@ aker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , &quot; he always has a short f@@ use . &quot;
does he think Trump will come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
guest house land@@ la@@ dy Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like many of K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s inhabitants , men@@ tions that des@@ cen@@ dants of the Hein@@ z family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald doing that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
she would prefer it if he doesn &apos;t win the election as &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know whether it would be a good thing . &quot;
if anyone like him had been in charge in his grand@@ father &apos;s time , &quot; he would never have gone there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says win@@ em@@ aker &apos;s daughter Sar@@ ah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; he &apos;s certainly not my president , &quot; she says .
and , &quot; the gra@@ pes will ri@@ pen without President Trump . &quot;
Wen@@ del &apos;s film , for which Trump gave a leng@@ thy interview , has been seen by 12@@ ,000 cinema @-@ go@@ ers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
the Upper Bav@@ arian district of Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village . &quot;
the village of 1,@@ 800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for &quot; Gent@@ le Tourism &quot; from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Lud@@ wig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ing , on Wednesday .
there are already 20 &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Vil@@ lages &quot; in Austria .
in our neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the distinction .
a &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village &quot; is permitted to have a maximum of 2,@@ 500 residents .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .

but Ha@@ y@@ ne chose the San Francisco 4@@ 9@@ ers and coach J@@ im Tom@@ sul@@ a and it &apos;s looking like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches would have ben@@ ched Ha@@ y@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a f@@ um@@ ble like the Aus@@ sie ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ague convert did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday &apos;s 20 @-@ 3 win against M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .

because of the large number of refugees , the Freie W@@ äh@@ ler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
at the start of the F@@ W autumn conc@@ la@@ ve , party and fac@@ tion leader Hu@@ bert Ai@@ wan@@ ger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new scho@@ ol@@ children : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collap@@ sing , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will have up@@ he@@ av@@ als in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Freie W@@ äh@@ ler fac@@ tion is in session in the Lo@@ wer Fran@@ con@@ ian community until Friday .
very different main topics were originally planned .
but the record number of refugees is domin@@ ating the Freie W@@ äh@@ ler meeting too .
&quot; of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ ve , &quot; says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugosla@@ vian war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; it can &apos;t go on like this , we have to get to the causes , &quot; says the Freie W@@ äh@@ ler head .
the Freie W@@ äh@@ ler want to de@@ port failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ min@@ str@@ ative courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , &quot; says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W head critic@@ ised the lack of consistency between several federal states : &quot; we need unified standards in the Federal states nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria de@@ ports ; others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we must be more efficient . &quot;
however , regional politics in Gross@@ w@@ ahl@@ stadt should not be allowed to suffer .
an issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
in the new school year the Education Minister , Lud@@ wig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , started a &quot; middle school plus &quot; pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in gramm@@ ars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification ex@@ am .
but that is not enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the G@@ 9 issue must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; says the F@@ W head .
we demand freedom of choice for all gram@@ mar schools that want it .
a free move to G@@ 9 everywhere it is wanted .
stronger Wall Street gives Da@@ x a helping hand
after an over @-@ long stretch of aim@@ less and ed@@ gy trading , the German stock market has closed with gains .
it was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a clearer direction which ultimately li@@ fted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10,@@ 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .

the markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains .
in the USA the D@@ ow J@@ ones index closed at about 1 percent up .
many bro@@ kers reck@@ on that markets will remain static until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also the major mat@@ urity of the fut@@ ures exchanges this Friday .
discussion about the impact due to the ph@@ asing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed R@@ WE stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on E@@ on .
according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies potentially lack € 30 billion in reserves .
the German Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
stocks in the two largest German energy businesses have subsequently recovered somewhat , although ultimately R@@ WE lost 3.@@ 31 percent and E@@ on 6.@@ 15 percent .
Infin@@ eon shares climb@@ ed to the top of the Da@@ x by a further 3.@@ 22 percent .
in the view of one tra@@ der , a positive report by US investment magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; at the weekend continues to have an effect .
according to him investors in the German chip manufacturer are currently paying too little attention
thus investment in the promising w@@ af@@ er technology and a focus on the automotive market should pay off .
car stocks were in demand : even in the traditionally week summer month of August , again more cars were sold than in the previous year period , as the manufacturers &apos; association Ac@@ ea dis@@ closed at the start of the International A@@ ot@@ om@@ o@@ bile Exhibition IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
stocks for car manufacturers Daim@@ ler and BMW , Op@@ el and Fi@@ at gained by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
stocks on Volkswagen increased in price by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German bond market , the current yield of listed Federal Government securities fell by 0.@@ 48 percent ( on Friday 0.@@ 50 percent ) .
the Re@@ x bond index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .

the rate of the Euro s@@ ank in the afternoon , ending at $ 1.@@ 12@@ 62 .
at around mid@@ day the European Central Bank had set the reference price at US $ 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .
this means that the dollar cost € 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) .
4 K@@ illed Af@@ ter Police F@@ ire Ru@@ b@@ ber Bul@@ lets at prote@@ sters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fi@@ red rubber bul@@ lets into a crow@@ d demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ h@@ i , about 175 miles west of K@@ ath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pra@@ sad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 prote@@ sters had gathered outside a police station , some of them thro@@ wing stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr. D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fi@@ red into the air before re@@ sor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less @-@ le@@ th@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clas@@ h was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal &apos;s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the Mad@@ h@@ es@@ i ethnic group say new provin@@ ces established under the proposed new constitution would di@@ lu@@ te their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clas@@ hes since Aug@@ .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provin@@ ces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly conten@@ tious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
law@@ makers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in K@@ ath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .
cont@@ ru@@ ction area planned in the town
the plot of land at the Al@@ te Post youth centre in Em@@ den is going to be built on again .
the town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square met@@ re area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Al@@ te Post youth centre .
preparations are currently underway .
it is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
a spokes@@ person for the town states that it is a@@ waiting suitable offers .
the identi@@ ties of possible investors are not yet clear .
consequently , no contract has yet been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den sold a part of the site , situated on the R@@ ing@@ strasse / corner of Gro@@ sse Strasse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demo@@ li@@ shed .
H@@ I@@ EV@@ E project : facts are in the open
plans for the holiday home development at the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are taking shape .
investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
a number of residents are again concerned - they are worried about the sale of their leisure refu@@ ge .
plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and pl@@ ot@@ ted behind closed doors for months .
now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are in the open .
the interested party , the Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
originally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
under pressure from critics of the project and from the F@@ DP fac@@ tion , who had accused investors and the administration of secre@@ tiveness , R@@ al@@ f Be@@ hr@@ ends of the System @-@ Bau management went on the offensive . &quot; we don &apos;t yet have an answer for all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spec@@ t@@ ators .
but it is good to be able to counter all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building pro@@ v@@ oked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Ro@@ berto Schulz , property owner and member of the board of the residents &apos; lobby group , Pro H@@ I@@ EV@@ E , claims : &quot; it &apos;s going to be a huge development which lo@@ oms over all the other buildings . &quot;
furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enor@@ m@@ ously due to the proposed size of the facility . &quot; we have to reck@@ on with whole bus@@ loads arriving , &quot; said Schulz .
however it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hec@@ t@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
no operator has yet been identified .
&quot; first of all we have to present a coherent concept , &quot; says R@@ al@@ f Be@@ hr@@ ends .
since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to vari@@ ation .

Google took an un@@ character@@ is@@ tically personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation drive on its blog .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who f@@ led Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
&quot; our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lu@@ cky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
the don@@ ations will go toward four non@@ profit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Wi@@ th@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Sa@@ ve the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.@@ 5 million worth of don@@ ations globally at goo@@ gle@@ .com / refu@@ ge@@ ere@@ lief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four @-@ year @-@ old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .

for mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with type 2 di@@ abetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with di@@ abetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ sur@@ gical treatments , however .
&quot; the mortality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an edi@@ torial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations , or b@@ ari@@ at@@ ric surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stom@@ ach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , b@@ ari@@ at@@ ric sur@@ geri@@ es have proved effective for treating type 2 di@@ abetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calcul@@ ate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s M@@ in @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hosp@@ ital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kinds of b@@ ari@@ at@@ ric surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ yp@@ ass and sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 di@@ abetes in people who were mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e .
the average BM@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I among those receiving non @-@ sur@@ gical di@@ abetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , di@@ abetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , by comparison , di@@ abetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L chol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the sur@@ gical group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead re@@ sear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 v@@ s 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger dro@@ ps in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 ) and in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 percent v@@ s 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ abetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent v@@ s 16.@@ 7 percent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of hea@@ vier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Ari@@ zona College of Medi@@ cine @-@ Pho@@ eni@@ x .
in the Swedish study , o@@ bes@@ e people who had b@@ ari@@ at@@ ric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s BM@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accumul@@ ated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into obe@@ sity and di@@ abetes , rever@@ sing that is really hard .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dal@@ ai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibet@@ an Buddh@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also stressed that , however ad@@ mi@@ rable , the West @-@ European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; it it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dal@@ ai Lama pra@@ ised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; so taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphasi@@ zed .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dal@@ ai Lama also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claim@@ ing that the US &quot; violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @-@ violence .
I know his mo@@ tives were good but he used force and it created un@@ expected consequences , &quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama said .
four@@ fold increase in children in@@ ge@@ sting hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er in last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 @-@ percent up@@ tick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 s@@ wal@@ lowing highly @-@ alcoholi@@ c hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord L@@ op@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er in@@ gestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ ison control centers went up from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez told CN@@ N .
he said some kids are drinking s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er inten@@ tionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or on a social @-@ media d@@ are .
videos on YouTube show te@@ en@@ agers drinking s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er for a cheap bu@@ z@@ z .
te@@ ens have re@@ porte@@ dly mixed s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er with alcohol @-@ containing m@@ ou@@ th@@ was@@ h for a sti@@ ffer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; a k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers ) are the ones that are s@@ cent@@ ed .
there are stra@@ w@@ berry , gra@@ pe , orange @-@ fla@@ vo@@ red hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers that are very appe@@ aling to kids .
hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control center at University of K@@ ans@@ as Hosp@@ ital , told Fo@@ x 4 in K@@ ans@@ as City .
so you w@@ ouldn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consu@@ me a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah R@@ ussel@@ l , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently in@@ ge@@ sted as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ berry @-@ s@@ cent@@ ed hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ un@@ k in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CN@@ N .
it could have been very le@@ th@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoholi@@ c products or s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ing wi@@ pes short of moving hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two On@@ tari@@ o women died after s@@ wal@@ lowing hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ing@@ re@@ dient .
health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained me@@ thanol , a dead@@ ly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ing@@ re@@ dient .
in January , three fourth @-@ grade students in up@@ state New York pl@@ ot@@ ted to po@@ ison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bac@@ teri@@ al products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly aller@@ gic to hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er and banned it from her room .
police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; i@@ dle ch@@ at@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

why I &apos;m A Wit@@ ness A@@ t An Ex@@ ecu@@ tion In Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p is executed by le@@ th@@ al injection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witn@@ esses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch execu@@ tions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ ter@@ y takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
wh@@ o@@ ever is picked will watch it disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a journalist accused me on Twitter of com@@ promising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the in@@ mate &apos;s story the way he li@@ kes it , get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have phra@@ sed it better , &quot; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I w@@ ouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witn@@ esses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ por@@ ter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publi@@ city will help the anti @-@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of po@@ d@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
man co@@ a@@ xed from C@@ ann@@ ing River after so@@ g@@ gy police ch@@ ase
the C@@ ann@@ ing V@@ ale con@@ stable remained dry as he co@@ a@@ xed the man from the C@@ ann@@ ing River .
a Per@@ th man &apos;s bid to lose a police tail came und@@ one after he found himself in shal@@ low , mu@@ d@@ dy water just metres from a police officer trying to &quot; co@@ ax him gently back to shore . &quot;
c@@ ann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called to a tre@@ sp@@ ass@@ ing incident in B@@ eck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they spot@@ ted the suspec@@ t he tried to di@@ t@@ ch them by heading into the C@@ ann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; he was standing in the water saying &apos; I &apos;m not getting out , &apos; come and get me &apos; , &quot; Seni@@ or Ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine said .
Con@@ stable L@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer t@@ acti@@ c - &quot; good police negotiation . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun@@ ny things to try and escape , &quot; Seni@@ or Ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine said .
champi@@ on foot@@ b@@ aller Ben Cou@@ sin@@ s provides a mem@@ orable example .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy al@@ leges ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y on him and threat@@ ens to qu@@ it racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy has alleged Rac@@ ing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to qu@@ it racing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and Rac@@ ing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Li@@ dari &apos;s positive s@@ wa@@ b to co@@ bal@@ t , which he can not explain .
he had bitten his ton@@ gue about the sp@@ y alleg@@ ations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like s@@ our gra@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so fru@@ str@@ ated it all comes out at once , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be a tra@@ iner .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
earlier , M@@ oo@@ dy had dropped the bom@@ b@@ shell in a rac@@ ing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr Bri@@ an Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com.
they obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
if that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their brie@@ fs because they &apos;ve been in@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bern@@ ard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of b@@ alls and maybe make people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that sad@@ dens me .
that really sad@@ dens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the tra@@ iner &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built with the long @-@ running co@@ bal@@ t inquiry involving Li@@ dari and the late sc@@ rat@@ ching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for preparing unbe@@ aten champi@@ on Black C@@ avi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a mu@@ d or cla@@ y poul@@ tice had been applied to the horses leg@@ s , which is against the rules .
it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
one of my staff mista@@ ken@@ ly lac@@ ed mu@@ d on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the poul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
Co@@ bra@@ m hit @-@ and @-@ run driver arrested

Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y h@@ its back at ri@@ vals over w@@ rest@@ ling claims
Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ R@@ L &apos;s two premi@@ ership favour@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson said the refer@@ ees allowed the Stor@@ m to &quot; w@@ rest@@ le &quot; his side during the Stor@@ m &apos;s up@@ set win in the quali@@ fying final in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos coach Wa@@ y@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a thin@@ ly v@@ ei@@ led reference to the Stor@@ m after his side &apos;s quali@@ fying final win over North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; show@@ case &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ague and said the two Que@@ ens@@ land weren &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bell@@ am@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Stor@@ m be@@ ating them .
&quot; that keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson bring up w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our def@@ ensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackl@@ es and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bell@@ am@@ y challeng@@ ed Ben@@ nett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett &apos;s St George @-@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the premi@@ ership in 2010 by playing &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
Wa@@ y@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
he made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and Wa@@ y@@ ne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably weren &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out the Stor@@ m and R@@ oo@@ sters game was a higher sc@@ oring contest than the Bron@@ cos and Co@@ w@@ boys game .
the Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t wat@@ ched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @-@ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @-@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not sc@@ oring tries that is exciting ?
to me it &apos;s agen@@ das .
if they are men@@ tioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the Stor@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ulla Sh@@ ark@@ s in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k b@@ ail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to poss@@ ess 40 ki@@ lo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine that was smu@@ gg@@ led into Que@@ ens@@ land has been granted b@@ ail on a $ 200@@ ,000 su@@ re@@ ty .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tra@@ cked 100 ki@@ lo@@ grams of the drug from the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and do@@ cked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed meeting with his co @-@ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house caf@@ e , where police found 40 ki@@ lo@@ grams of the drug in a To@@ y@@ ota E@@ cho .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to poss@@ ess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to poss@@ ess all of it and that he might have been at the caf@@ e for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Ju@@ dge Peter F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an was concerned Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he tra@@ vels to Serbia often , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
on the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200@@ ,000 to secure his release .
&quot; having read the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200@@ ,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &quot; Ju@@ dge F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was granted b@@ ail on the conditions that he sur@@ render both his Austra@@ lian and Serbian pas@@ sports , report to police on a daily basis and ad@@ heres to a 6@@ pm @-@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .

Ste@@ van Ho@@ gg used girls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s phone to so@@ lic@@ it child abuse images .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she sle@@ pt then log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service where he had a succ@@ ession of inde@@ cent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Ho@@ gg &apos;s hand .
she looked through it and found the distur@@ bing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web sear@@ ches using terms for finding inde@@ cent image of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les &quot; on the internet before &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . &quot;
fiscal Dep@@ ute E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Ro@@ ber@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ de@@ e S@@ heri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it was an addi@@ ction - that he was addi@@ c@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he accepted the sear@@ ches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
he was asked about his con@@ vers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was si@@ ck in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rap@@ e and murder images .
Ms Ro@@ ber@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was sha@@ king and cr@@ ying .
she saw the inde@@ cent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , of W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on indic@@ tment to charges of taking or making inde@@ cent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching b@@ ail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence so@@ lic@@ it@@ or G@@ reg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg not be placed on the sex offen@@ ders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .

traffi@@ ckers move towards Germany over minor border cro@@ s@@ sin@@ gs .
more and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many traffi@@ ckers are leaving
through minor borders on the Austrian side , says a spokes@@ person for the Federal police .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had arrived on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs on the German side .
they are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration .
according to reports from the Federal police , significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week .
by 8 a.m. about 700 people had arrived in the capital city of the state , said a spokes@@ person in the morning .
following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian borders , 1,@@ 7@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : tail end of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south west
met@@ e@@ or@@ ologi@@ sts are warning of squ@@ alls in the south west from Wednesday evening onwards .
due to a de@@ pression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is f@@ lowing into the country , the German Met@@ e@@ or@@ ological service ( D@@ W@@ D ) has advised .
the powerful trou@@ gh is the tail end of tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has moved over the Atlantic from the Ber@@ mu@@ da Islands in the last few days .
violent stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are anticipated , particularly in Baden .
according to D@@ W@@ D , gu@@ sts of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour can be anticipated on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Mountains and in Boden@@ seek@@ re@@ is .
on Friday the sun is forec@@ ast@@ ed to put in a longer appearance once again
the ch@@ as@@ sis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IA@@ A
in 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
compact class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( K@@ BA ) about 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ str@@ ations in August alone belon@@ ged to this segment .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
in among all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high @-@ end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car sector here is the Op@@ el A@@ stra , which h@@ its the car deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Op@@ el bo@@ ss Karl @-@ Thomas Ne@@ um@@ ann at the show .
it is at the heart of the brand .
to ensure that it s@@ ells well , the price of the new A@@ stra is not increasing significantly .
Op@@ el proposes an entry point below that of its main competi@@ tor , the V@@ W Golf , which starts at € 17@@ ,@@ 650 .
the latest A@@ stra costs from € 16@@ ,@@ 9@@ 90 .
with a new 1.4 li@@ tre engine , the A@@ stra has an output of 74 k@@ w / 100 h@@ p .
the H@@ essi@@ an manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 k@@ w / 95 h@@ p to 14@@ 7 k@@ w / 200 h@@ p , including the first three cy@@ linder petrol model .
unlike its most important competitors , V@@ W Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the Op@@ el A@@ stra is only available as a five door .
in spring the estate car , already seen at the IA@@ A , will follow as the second option
and what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competi@@ tor to the A@@ stra , the Mé@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five @-@ door , in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
it will be available in deal@@ er@@ ships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
the N@@ iss@@ an off@@ sh@@ oot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its cur@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ w / 12@@ 2 h@@ p .
a diesel with 80 k@@ w / 109 h@@ p or 125 k@@ w / 170 h@@ p is also on offer .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : also new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celeb@@ rates its world premi@@ ere in Frankfurt .
on offer is the petrol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 li@@ tre tur@@ bo engine and a performance of 82 k@@ w / 111 h@@ p .
according to the man@@ fac@@ tur@@ er &apos;s specifications , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton metres ( N@@ m ) .
the Bal@@ eno is launched in Europe in early 2016 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely re@@ designed , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
the designers at the class@@ y Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n off@@ sh@@ oot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator gri@@ lle has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology .
in the interior the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system in particular has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play has been incorporated .
in the compact class the IA@@ A also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the P@@ eu@@ ge@@ ot 30@@ 8 .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five @-@ square @-@ met@@ re cells are un@@ fit for human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court has uph@@ eld a complaint by a former in@@ mate of Te@@ gel prison that he had been hous@@ ed for months in too small a cell .
in principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
the Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
according to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 12@@ 7 / 14 ) .
for this reason a former prison@@ er was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karls@@ ruhe . he was de@@ tained in Berlin Te@@ gel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
afterwards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
his liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of un@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
but the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and re@@ submitted the case there for renewed assessment .
in their view the human dignity of the man had been viol@@ ated .
the Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in cu@@ sto@@ dy are significant for compensation , enti@@ t@@ lement to a claim for compensation exists .
otherwise there would be &quot; fears of deterioration of a person &apos;s right to protection . &quot;
the Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
as recently as April they awarded damages to a prison@@ er because he had been locked in his cell n@@ aked .
a cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also in@@ humane , according to a decision from 2011 .
furthermore Karls@@ ruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prison@@ er in a parallel case in November 2009 had at@@ tested to in@@ humane accommodation
the prison@@ er at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karls@@ ruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the press office of the public prosec@@ utor , 21 positions in Te@@ gel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 2016 .
Angel@@ a Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we can handle it &quot;
the influ@@ x of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what changes will we see in Germany ?
according to the predic@@ tions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Si@@ g@@ mar G@@ abri@@ el ( SP@@ D ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angel@@ a Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . &quot; I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . &quot;
the following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
according to various forecasts between 35@@ 0,000 ( estim@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation by the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
that is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 25@@ 0,000 homes ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 6@@ 0,000 and 8@@ 0,000 social d@@ well@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Barb@@ ara H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks ( SP@@ D ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
in the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute this is far too little : 8@@ 0,000 social d@@ well@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
acade@@ mics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
however the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , critic@@ ised Clau@@ dia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the im@@ migrant says migration re@@ sear@@ cher Di@@ et@@ rich T@@ hr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to T@@ hr@@ än@@ hardt , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
while in the past asylum seekers were forbi@@ dden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of dom@@ ici@@ le .
as far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
one big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
to date there is still no adequate supply of general and work @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
thus , in T@@ hr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kin@@ der@@ garten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Sen@@ ate administration .
to be able to convince families of the benefits of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issuing le@@ af@@ lets in a number of languages .
if the need for teachers increases shar@@ ply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Sen@@ ate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical col@@ leges .
in the states , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
however they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state prohib@@ its asylum seekers or those with long @-@ term refugee status from studying - the only exception up to now was Berlin : Sen@@ ator for the Interior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has however now abandoned his stance .
refugees who want to study may have their entrance to university facilit@@ ated .
refugees with a residence permit or protection against de@@ port@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
in principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
toler@@ ated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , claim Ste@@ ffen kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
the students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state @-@ church law should be developed into a state @-@ religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arri@@ vals in a professional manner , is also important .
rights also involve responsibilities .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to conc@@ ede certain control options .
this also requires the readiness to act cour@@ age@@ ously against religious fundamentali@@ sm .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
those who want to wage such conflict in Germany &quot; have immediately for@@ f@@ eit@@ ed their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said on Bav@@ arian radio .
he suggested transl@@ ating this basic law into Ara@@ bic .
in the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
this means too that main@@ stream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
for nearly 10 years , as a result of European rul@@ ings , Germany has had an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
but it is learning very slowly , as the N@@ S@@ U murder series shows , that rac@@ ist mo@@ tives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and non @-@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doc@@ tors &apos; Association , Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we can cope , &quot; he told the Tages@@ sp@@ ie@@ gel .
however extra money must be added to the system for this .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asked for all new arri@@ vals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
services provided can be accoun@@ ted for with the Federal states later .
and in the long term it is highly doub@@ t@@ ful that so many people can be f@@ ob@@ bed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Ben@@ ef@@ its for Asyl@@ um Se@@ ek@@ ers Act provides .
apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
up to now , as Berlin health re@@ sear@@ cher The@@ a Bor@@ de has established , migrants have received poorer information about their ill@@ nesses than other patients .
interpre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors &apos; practices , she demands .
but many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine drop @-@ in centres in emergency rooms .
and with a different diagno@@ stic view .
refugee children for example clearly suffer from more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery
&quot; para@@ site infec@@ tions or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not that difficult to recognise . &quot; and because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exam@@ s .
in the estim@@ ation of the Federal Psy@@ cho@@ therapeutic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them are suffering from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order or de@@ pression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a soon @-@ to @-@ be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arri@@ ves trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order suffer among other things from so @-@ called f@@ las@@ h@@ backs , difficulties in brea@@ thing , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration dis@@ orders , ner@@ v@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
mentally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
in addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological ill@@ nesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this frequently leads to false assessments , says Mun@@ z .
the ring invites you to dream
with their new &quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; production , Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st is returning to the traditions of the art of the cir@@ cus .
the aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mes@@ mer@@ ising ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dre@@ s@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Zie@@ gel@@ was@@ en .
&quot; our passion is our cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Ste@@ phan@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st , animal tra@@ iner and j@@ unior manager .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the mot@@ to for the current production in the ring .
the cir@@ cus has been owned by the Pro@@ b@@ st family for over 33 years .
the family has the gift of enth@@ r@@ alling people in their blood .
&quot; it &apos;s important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old j@@ unior manager .
Director Rein@@ hard Pro@@ b@@ st calls his concept a &quot; Cock@@ tail in the ring with a co@@ smo@@ politan fla@@ ir . &quot;
fifty towns have the chance to experience this fla@@ ir on the almost 3000 kilomet@@ re @-@ long tour .
the cir@@ cus programme wins people over with tal@@ ented artists from all over the world .
distinguished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v clo@@ wn family cap@@ tiv@@ ate the public with wi@@ t and charm .
the Casti@@ llo bro@@ thers , too , know their craft .
the Cu@@ ban du@@ o are ready to compete with the her@@ oes of silent films .
ligh@@ tness and agi@@ lity - these words sum them up .
their hum@@ or@@ ous arti@@ stry on the pole will win the women &apos;s hearts .
apart from causing numerous bur@@ sts of lau@@ ghter , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ st &apos;s ac@@ rob@@ ats are also mes@@ mer@@ ising with their fin@@ esse and sup@@ pl@@ eness .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; insi@@ sts St@@ ap@@ han@@ ie &apos;s mother , Bri@@ git@@ te Pro@@ b@@ st .
different animal welfare organisations all too often compla@@ in about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of cir@@ cus animals .
Ste@@ phan@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st has her own answer to this : &quot; if our animals aren &apos;t happy , then nor are we . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different contin@@ ents enjoy every bit of attention .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; as they are affec@@ tion@@ ately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go in the ring either .
so the top priority is to look after the animals well .
the Pro@@ b@@ st family are especially proud of their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id , J@@ umb@@ o - the off@@ spring of a Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony stal@@ lion and a z@@ eb@@ ra mare .
the two animals lived together in one en@@ closure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; then suddenly there was our little J@@ umb@@ o , &quot; says Bri@@ git@@ te Pro@@ b@@ st .
but the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mas@@ co@@ t for the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st .
there is something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for certain , &quot; says Ste@@ phan@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st , &quot; regardless of whether there are five or 1,@@ 200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
the programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
and the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ dium .
he was un@@ h@@ urt , but video of the fall went vi@@ ral on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tar@@ nis@@ hed by claims by opposition legislat@@ ors that they had received an@@ onymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kl@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief whi@@ p In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to dis@@ rupt N@@ r Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s ti@@ tled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
it war@@ ns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief whi@@ p said the party , led by Mor@@ gan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 3@@ 0,000 jobs
He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25@@ ,000 to 3@@ 0,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @-@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is sp@@ lit@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and printer businesses from its faster @-@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evol@@ ving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will have more than $ 50@@ bn in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 19@@ 30@@ s by Stan@@ ford University gradu@@ ates Bill He@@ wle@@ tt and Da@@ ve Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to garage has been du@@ b@@ bed &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has been under@@ going a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
ar@@ sen@@ al cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says team @-@ m@@ ates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of D@@ in@@ amo Zagreb tie
W@@ enger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
that best @-@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Championship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then looked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not career @-@ threatening , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that did not he@@ al well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the in@@ juries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as W@@ enger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further in@@ juries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
there is also an un@@ comfortable pattern developing .
research by Premier In@@ juries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 le@@ ague games during the last five seas@@ ons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight seas@@ ons since 2007 @-@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Ar@@ sen@@ al believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with Ar@@ sen@@ al beginning their Champi@@ ons League campaign on Wednesday night against D@@ in@@ amo Zagreb ahead of matches with C@@ hel@@ sea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , W@@ enger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not trav@@ elled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u De@@ buch@@ y and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
W@@ enger may also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe &apos;s most in@@ timi@@ dating .
D@@ in@@ amo are also unbe@@ aten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; Inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an earth tre@@ m@@ or that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
it was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ enger believes that Ar@@ sen@@ al have lear@@ nt the lesson of last season &apos;s Champi@@ ons League cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup tri@@ um@@ ph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been done at Ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that taught us serious lessons about male friend@@ ship
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is g@@ lar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desper@@ ate now than ever , with suici@@ de rates amongst young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than fem@@ ales .
in a bid to address the problem , the Camp@@ ai@@ gn Aga@@ inst Li@@ ving mis@@ er@@ ably ( C@@ AL@@ M ) announced 2015 as the Year of the M@@ ale , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friend@@ ship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2@@ ,000 high @-@ school students displa@@ ying de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recover@@ ing doub@@ led .
equally , for those not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friend@@ ship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social @-@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often priori@@ ti@@ sed over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doub@@ led the need to appear strong , fun @-@ lo@@ ving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologi@@ sts term ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner ye@@ ar@@ ning for personal growth and friend@@ ship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
and as a billi@@ on@@ aire video @-@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happ@@ iness .
the beauty of Fri@@ ends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ro@@ ss &apos;s p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling de@@ pressed and suici@@ dal has really highlighted how even the smallest inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ada@@ ge of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friend@@ ship .
as much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central &apos;s Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a s@@ mile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friend@@ ship could make .
friends is broadcasting on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 23@@ 6 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria sco@@ res to help PS@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after sc@@ oring against Mal@@ mo .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria sco@@ red on his Champi@@ ons League de@@ but to help PS@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main began their Champi@@ ons League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des Prin@@ ces on Tuesday .
di Maria sco@@ red less than four minutes into his Champi@@ ons League de@@ but as a PS@@ G player to set the French champi@@ ons on their way , but they missed a succ@@ ession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ h@@ tar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champi@@ ons as they target not just qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out ro@@ unds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c &apos;s side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c wa@@ ste@@ ful in front of goal and later being sub@@ stituted against his hom@@ et@@ own team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champi@@ ons League , so to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said Blan@@ c .
it au@@ g@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ aux in Li@@ gue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ st@@ aged in the fourth minute by D@@ i Maria .
the Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ i &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected PS@@ G to ro@@ mp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at k@@ ick @-@ off and , with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of K@@ ev@@ in Tra@@ pp &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PS@@ G let themselves down at times with some wa@@ ste@@ ful passing and poor finishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the re@@ start .
nevertheless , he proved much more ade@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c pass that D@@ i Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had fli@@ cked on a left @-@ wing cross from Max@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wil@@ and from point @-@ blan@@ k range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach Age Ha@@ rei@@ de later admitted PS@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : &quot; our last Champi@@ ons League game was in December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague which is not the same level .
the quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
h@@ ats off to Paris .
it was a magnificent match from them .
G@@ len@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss @-@ based mining giant G@@ len@@ core , hit by collap@@ sing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt @-@ s@@ las@@ hing plan .
London @-@ listed G@@ len@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is gra@@ p@@ pling with tu@@ mb@@ ling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic slow@@ down weigh@@ s on demand and spark@@ s ha@@ vo@@ c across markets .
the rights issue sent G@@ len@@ core &apos;s share price so@@ aring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
shares jum@@ ped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
G@@ len@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @-@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to s@@ lash its $ 30 billion debt pi@@ le by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 125 p@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.4 @-@ percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
it off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns over prolon@@ ged st@@ alled Chinese growth have s@@ las@@ hed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .

white House Con@@ firms X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping &apos;s Washington Vi@@ sit
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ i &apos;s first official one to Washington , will take place on Sep@@ t . 25 and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
the U.S. President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ u@@ an at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will present an opportunity to expand U.@@ S.@@ -@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President X@@ i to address areas of dis@@ agreement construc@@ tively , &quot; the statement added .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.@@ N@@ . General Assembly on Sep@@ t .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to bro@@ ach a range of conten@@ tious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns over China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and its increasing asser@@ tiveness in the disp@@ uted waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champi@@ on X@@ av@@ i has played for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Q@@ atar since summer 2015 .
a few years ago , FC Bayern was apparently close to commit@@ ting to Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champi@@ on , three times cup winner , four times Champi@@ ons League winner , twice club world champi@@ on , twice European champi@@ on , one time world champi@@ on - X@@ av@@ i &apos;s list of titles is bre@@ ath @-@ taking .
in the summer the then 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Q@@ atar and the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
&quot; I was told that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; at the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren &apos;t , &quot; he says .
and FC Bayern noticed that too .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bayern . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ i@@ g@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
a quick remin@@ der : in the summer of 2008 , Jür@@ gen K@@ lin@@ s@@ mann took over at FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not transfer .
the transfer never happened .
and instead the crucial man now works for the German record champi@@ on : pe@@ p Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why . &quot; Bar@@ ça had signed on Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Championship . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ep@@ e told me that I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t transfer , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;

Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in fil@@ m@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted African @-@ American fil@@ m@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during Sunday night &apos;s episode of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project Green@@ Light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasi@@ zing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play .
&quot; when we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on asser@@ ted .
sho@@ cked , Brown re@@ acted with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief , let@@ ting out &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wo@@ W . ok@@ ay , &quot; as The Mar@@ tian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly bro@@ thers to discuss the show &apos;s fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about -- wh@@ o@@ ever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown initially said .
the only black character who &apos;s a ho@@ ok@@ er who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ tor@@ ted their direc@@ ting could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , social media explo@@ ded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WH@@ IT@@ E it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5@@ ,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4@@ ,000 li@@ kes since being posted .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate ra@@ cial representation in media is at the fo@@ refront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nation@@ wide effect , ur@@ ging law@@ makers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
in February , singer Prince all@@ u@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nom@@ ine@@ es of Album of the Year at the Gra@@ mm@@ y Awards .
&quot; al@@ bu@@ ms still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black lives , al@@ bu@@ ms still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fo@@ x News personality Elisa@@ beth Has@@ sel@@ beck &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a h@@ ate group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ g@@ ul@@ s invited to visit the P@@ ope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s portra@@ yal in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the P@@ ope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; cro@@ wns first champi@@ on
pro @-@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy Isa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athle@@ te to win American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just wra@@ pped up its 7th season , has never seen any competi@@ tor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved climbing a 75 @-@ foot ro@@ pe in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first @-@ ever athle@@ te to complete American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos;s gru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , like I &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; Isa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay @-@ bu@@ mp .
so to all of a sudden ... like I can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ por@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever competi@@ tor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ is@@ her , the one with the fastest time gets it , &quot; said We@@ ed .
as much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great grati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ arb@@ ors any ill will about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
he &apos;s received tons of acc@@ ol@@ ades from fans .
he &apos;s such a great guy , and a family man .
he &apos;s a her@@ o to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was going to be beat by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isa@@ ac . &quot;
and I think Isa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were rever@@ sed .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was renewed for an eigh@@ th season , which will begin fil@@ ming in Spring 2016 .
Det@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
Min@@ ne@@ a@@ polis -- The second half the season h@@ as@@ n &apos;t been a lot of fun for the Det@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers .
once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the Ti@@ gers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a spo@@ iler , the Ti@@ gers played the part perfectly Tuesday , be@@ ating the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins 5 @-@ 4 at Tar@@ get F@@ ield .
the T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to clim@@ b to within one @-@ half game of the H@@ ou@@ ston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild @-@ card spot .
for Det@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three @-@ letter F @-@ word that has been so el@@ u@@ sive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it happens , &quot; Ti@@ gers manager Bra@@ d Aus@@ mus said .
Ti@@ gers pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Det@@ ro@@ it sco@@ red three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then tack@@ ed one in the sixth and one more in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) pit@@ ched 6 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
&quot; I just want to finish strong this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
Ti@@ gers designated hit@@ ter Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three h@@ its and dro@@ ve in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit night since he had four h@@ its against the Seattle Mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the bat well , &quot; Aus@@ mus said .
he looked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the se@@ venth inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center fiel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
right fiel@@ der Aar@@ on Hi@@ cks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Simon got second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ zi@@ er to strike out sw@@ ing@@ ing before being li@@ fted for left @-@ han@@ der Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy wal@@ ked M@@ auer , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated hit@@ ter Miguel S@@ ano , who ri@@ pped a two @-@ run single to left off right @-@ han@@ der Dre@@ w VER@@ H@@ AG@@ EN .
with a pair of run@@ ners on and the t@@ ying run at second , VER@@ H@@ AG@@ EN got third bas@@ em@@ an Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to ground into a double play .
it was the major @-@ le@@ ague @-@ leading 27@@ th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit into a DP .
after Det@@ ro@@ it tack@@ ed on an insurance run in the top of the nin@@ th , M@@ auer ri@@ pped an R@@ BI double to the gap against Ti@@ gers closer Bru@@ ce Ron@@ don to make it 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ han@@ der struck out S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ sty Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es in the early going .
the Ti@@ gers posted three runs in the first two inn@@ ings against the veter@@ an right @-@ han@@ der , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inf@@ lam@@ mation .
&quot; obviously not the start I &apos;d like to have , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after getting the le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , hus@@ hes gave up a single to second bas@@ em@@ an I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk to right fiel@@ der J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z sn@@ apped his 0 @-@ for @-@ 21 stre@@ ak with run@@ ners in sc@@ oring position .
third bas@@ em@@ an N@@ ick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single to right , sc@@ oring another run , but Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Ti@@ gers added on in the second , getting a one @-@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two @-@ out single by center fiel@@ der Anth@@ ony Go@@ se to make it 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big hit , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor said .
he didn &apos;t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was on a pit@@ ch count , pit@@ ched a sco@@ reless third inning before being replaced by right @-@ handed relie@@ ver A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was charged with three runs on six h@@ its and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Ti@@ gers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was shut down with a stra@@ in in his thro@@ wing shoulder .
he will be examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ chez &apos;s shoulder back in 2007 .
San@@ chez , on the disabled list with a shoulder stra@@ in since mid @-@ August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
with San@@ chez out , L@@ HP Daniel Nor@@ ris will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris is 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Ti@@ gers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Pri@@ ce on July 30 .
he has been out since Aug@@ . 20 with a stra@@ ined right obli@@ que .
the Ti@@ gers and T@@ wins will wra@@ p up their three @-@ game series at Tar@@ get F@@ ield on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will oppose M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ER@@ A ) .
hundreds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wi@@ es@@ ba@@ den
a train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
they are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
the people who have trav@@ elled there will then be hous@@ ed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wi@@ es@@ ba@@ den , according to a statement made by the city of Wi@@ es@@ ba@@ den on Tuesday evening .
they estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
a number of sports h@@ alls in the H@@ essi@@ an capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the last few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
after this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
according to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ essen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone
due to the large number of refugees , emergency shel@@ ter has also been set up in sports h@@ alls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
I@@ sch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang I@@ sch@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
&quot; I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he accused the European nations of &quot; collec@@ tively looking the other way . &quot;
four years ago one would have been happy for the ch@@ ali@@ ce of military involvement to pass Germany by .
&quot; now the conflict has come cra@@ shing down at our front door , &quot; he said on the German World Service .
the former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister , Johann@@ a Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , stated on the Austrian television channel OR@@ F on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is the agreement , &quot; she confirmed .
on the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
she gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so @-@ called Balkan route .
most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angel@@ a Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
on Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
to date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory re@@ distribution of a further 120@@ ,000 refugees .
in view of the heavy influ@@ x of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
the Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
but those who have no prospects of permanent re@@ sidency will not be able to stay in Germany .
this opinion is also clearly generally shared .
the Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are currently stu@@ ck on the Balkan route .
on Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to se@@ al off the border with Romania with a f@@ ence .
unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to about the planned new border f@@ ences .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
the first arre@@ sts of people who had bre@@ ached the f@@ ence have taken place .
in Turkey meanwhile , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .
&quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; space probe finds ocean on Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ic@@ y cr@@ ust of Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus sp@@ las@@ hes a global ocean .
scientists have deduc@@ ed this from ob@@ serving the &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; space probe
this is the reason the moon w@@ ob@@ bles slightly in its or@@ bit of the ring@@ ed planet .
this w@@ ob@@ bling is only minor , but nevertheless too much for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Cor@@ n@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ ica in the US state of New York .
the scientists have published their findings in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; scientific jour@@ nal .
it has long been known that there must be liquid water under En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus &apos;s cr@@ ust of ice .
&quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes , which spe@@ w water v@@ ap@@ our and ice partic@@ les that feed the so @-@ called E ring of Satur@@ n , at the south pole of this moon in 2006 .
Ast@@ onom@@ ers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the south pole .
the extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama ab@@ sent from 18@@ 60 Munich for several weeks
18@@ 60 Munich must do without att@@ acking mid@@ fiel@@ der Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an examination revealed that the 27 @-@ year @-@ old has suffered an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined of pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; probably a four week compulsory break . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bit@@ ter loss . &quot;
&quot; we have to think about it of course , &quot; Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
however the next training guest the sex@@ agen@@ arian is due to present is a def@@ ender .
thirty @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg .
at the moment the Croatian has &quot; the opportunity to prove himself . &quot;
following his conc@@ ussion , goal sc@@ orer Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie is returning to training with the team in the coming week .
the Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday .
O@@ ko@@ tie sustained a head injury in a violent col@@ li@@ sion in the match with Fort@@ una D@@ ussel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
contrary to initial fears , however , the wo@@ und was not serious .
not a diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic , ju@@ ic@@ y and sweet .
but any@@ body watching their wa@@ ist@@ line should avoid them .
because man@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content - primarily su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vit@@ am@@ ins as well as vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. Bu@@ t most of all man@@ goes are full of vit@@ amin A and its pre@@ cur@@ sor , bet@@ a @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
eating the fruit boo@@ sts the sight , imm@@ une system and the body &apos;s met@@ abo@@ lic processes .
when buying man@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant arom@@ a .
it is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ri@@ pe the fruit is - even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consu@@ med within a few days .
they are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch even to sa@@ vo@@ ury dishes .
they mitig@@ ate the slightly bit@@ ter taste of some lea@@ f sal@@ ads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ chio .
and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lam@@ b and game .

first a fo@@ eh@@ n storm , then a pron@@ ounced cold front
the fo@@ eh@@ n will break through in the val@@ leys on the nor@@ then side of the Alps in the coming night , Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
the fo@@ eh@@ n will b@@ low through the Fo@@ eh@@ n Valle@@ ys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at g@@ ale force .
once the fo@@ eh@@ n has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , gu@@ sty win@@ ds and a drop in temperature .
according to Met@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Is@@ les in a strong sou@@ th@@ western flow .
the fo@@ eh@@ n will break through the val@@ leys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night .
the fo@@ eh@@ n will then b@@ low through the Fo@@ eh@@ n Valle@@ ys until Thursday morning with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the c@@ anton of Ur@@ i , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
in places the fo@@ eh@@ n may advance into the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains g@@ ale force win@@ ds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
while in the north stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ ns on Wednesday will bring summ@@ ery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , mo@@ ist@@ ure will begin to build up on the southern slopes of the Alps .
here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening .
over the next 48 hours the south of the Alps can expect over 100 lit@@ res of rain per square met@@ re in places , following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n will die down , resulting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes th@@ under@@ y rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland .
in conjunction with the cold front , the wind will get stronger increasing to stor@@ my , and temperatures will decrease shar@@ ply .

Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square
some 500 years after the Reform@@ ation , Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square .
in the presence of the Mayor of the City , I@@ gn@@ a@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hi@@ ther@@ to un@@ named square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was on Wednesday be@@ sto@@ wed with the name of the German re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin L@@ ut@@ re@@ o &quot; he is now recognised as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reform@@ ation . &quot;
the park is in the centre of Rome right next to the Colo@@ sse@@ um
the con@@ sortium of Ev@@ ange@@ li@@ cal churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the Ev@@ ange@@ li@@ cal Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Prote@@ stants in the P@@ ope &apos;s city often had to hide their faith .
the square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
as a young Augu@@ st@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
at the time he considered the city to be a de@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impres@@ sions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther her@@ al@@ ded the beginning of the Western Church with his th@@ eses against the selling of indul@@ gen@@ ces .
tal@@ ented artist inv@@ ests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar A@@ lt has painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bi@@ ble .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Bi@@ ble , which has now been issued with magnificent pictures .
for Ot@@ mar A@@ lt , who has de@@ vised his own personal interpretation of bi@@ bli@@ cal stories in 150 moti@@ fs on paper and can@@ vas , in the beginning was the picture .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old conceived his &quot; language &quot; with bright colours and imagin@@ ative forms - which are however by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; fun@@ ny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly glo@@ om@@ y .
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt worked on his Bi@@ ble project for around three years and for this project he made a sub@@ jec@@ tive choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the &quot; Book of books . &quot;
cycles evol@@ ved , dedicated to topics such as the W@@ ay of the Cross , pla@@ gues , the Comm@@ and@@ ments or the Lord &apos;s Pra@@ yer .
without even appro@@ aching them , he immediately att@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag , a publish@@ er speciali@@ sing in the@@ ological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler Verlag , who focus on publishing art books .
and in particular author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has gra@@ p@@ pled with the particular Bi@@ ble pass@@ ages based on the paintings .
he has interpreted the Bi@@ ble texts selected by Ot@@ mar A@@ lt and &quot; translated &quot; them to the current day , in a topical context .
these texts are like verb@@ al mir@@ rors of A@@ lt &apos;s paintings .
they are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble quot@@ ations of Martin Lu@@ ther and each composition by the artist , who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
the decorated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows at the same time a tw@@ o@@ fold insight , deep into both his soul and his emo@@ tions .
this is particularly intimate .
ultimately , his emo@@ tions were the key trigger for the Bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar A@@ lt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 19@@ 40 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Prote@@ stant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ t order .
&quot; education there took place under the shadow of the cane , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar A@@ lt .
&quot; I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
his second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : &quot; the perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
symboli@@ sm has been driven out .
artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
pictures always have something myst@@ eri@@ ous about them ; they are not decoration .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ o@@ sau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt wants his vie@@ wers to let themselves &quot; fall into &quot; the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
at the launch of the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Bi@@ ble on Tuesday , Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ essed to having &quot; always &quot; been a lo@@ ver of Ot@@ mar A@@ lt &apos;s art : &quot; I like the way he sees life with his pictures . &quot;
A@@ lt was not interested in recording the whole of the Bi@@ ble , selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most myst@@ eri@@ ous .
&quot; this wasn &apos;t a collaboration between partners , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post , &quot; it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . &quot; the result is a picture Bi@@ ble .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of the Lu@@ ther Verlag this work is an invitation &quot; to add depth to his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt &apos;s pictures speak , for Mö@@ h@@ ler , the ( bi@@ bli@@ cal ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
some of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ vas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Foundation .
start of construction draws closer for BM@@ X track
plans made , site found , company commissioned , mo@@ und for a circuit mod@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
political and administrative fail@@ ings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
so the mo@@ und was demo@@ li@@ shed and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
approval will be received in October , chief local coun@@ ci@@ ll@@ or Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ B@@ och has now been able to inform the children &apos;s and young people &apos;s committee .
&quot; I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , &quot; she said .
the work should then be started without any &quot; further pause for thought &quot; at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
the German football le@@ ague gave clear indications at the weekend that the DF@@ B is extending its commitment to refugees to 201@@ 9 .
football has re@@ acted to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; basically nobody knows , it &apos;s no concern of mine , it &apos;s not my doing . &quot;
&quot; it is in the interests of everybody to get to gri@@ p with this issue , &quot; says DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
he wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angel@@ a Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I &apos;m going to be in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and I &apos;m meeting there with State Minister Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure the topic will play a central role there , &quot; he announ@@ ces .
football can and will help .
but the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
the German Foot@@ ball Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Brau@@ n foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 201@@ 9 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the U@@ EFA meeting in St Ju@@ lian &apos;s , Malta
several teams are also supporting the programme .
this very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words &quot; We are helping - # refu@@ ge@@ es@@ welcome &quot; on the left sle@@ eve of their strip instead of the usual spons@@ or &apos;s logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ en &apos;s sport bo@@ ss Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as &quot; a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; the refugee dra@@ ma concerns everyone , nobody can look away . &quot;
&quot; we football teams can , no , we must use our char@@ is@@ ma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , &quot; says Her@@ th@@ a manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent signal by the le@@ ague .
the women &apos;s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Sa@@ ale ) for the World Cup quali@@ fying match against Hungary .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes supporting the refugees as &quot; a grand joint effort by German football . &quot;
it is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
it is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; that we have sent out is being lived in football .
&quot; that is of enormous significance , &quot; he said .
in both this year and next year the association together with the DF@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300@@ ,000 available for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; reports Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
reports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
in an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA after mid@@ night , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ wo@@ che &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he almost bled to death , he was un@@ conscious , then he dra@@ gged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ wo &quot; quoted SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ tner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t will however be able to return to work .
&quot; we are meeting up at the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf at the beginning of October , &quot; said Plat@@ tner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager will be at the meeting and &quot; fully fit for work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutschen Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
&quot; I am definitely there for SAP , completely involved in my job . &quot;
&quot; I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Has@@ so Plat@@ tner , the whole time , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t told the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
II is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; it could happen to anyone . &quot;
&quot; the important thing is to get up again if you fall down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren reserve driver Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen out of action ...
Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen twi@@ tter@@ ed a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike .
this means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers , Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as sli@@ m as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later .
football : B@@ V@@ B v Kra@@ s@@ no@@ dar without Re@@ us : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in goal
all hopes have been cr@@ us@@ hed for Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dor@@ t@@ mund that Marco Re@@ us might make a com@@ eb@@ ack in the first group match of the European le@@ ague .
the international player will also be missing from the German Bundes@@ li@@ ga leader &apos;s match in its dual with F@@ K Kra@@ s@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately he isn &apos;t in the running , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
the B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether Re@@ us will be there on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga top match against Le@@ verk@@ us@@ en : &quot; we are expec@@ ting him to return to training on Friday . &quot;
in light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Re@@ us &apos;s position .
so he has announced a change of go@@ al@@ keep@@ er .
thus Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of regular keep@@ er Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he &apos;s training at absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the world champi@@ on &apos;s football coach .
Tu@@ ch@@ el is leaving it open as to whether Wei@@ den@@ felder will be used in all European le@@ ague matches in the future .
it is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
mid@@ fiel@@ der Ju@@ lian Wei@@ gl considers team mate Re@@ us &apos;s br@@ is@@ k statement that the final of the European le@@ ague must be B@@ V@@ B &apos;s objective quite understandable : &quot; Marco isn &apos;t so far off the mark with that . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;ve got a good chance of pi@@ cking up the title . &quot;
ro@@ bot cars : government wants Germany to take a leading role
the Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
on Wednesday the German cab@@ inet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the br@@ ink of the IA@@ A motor show , about a &quot; new era of mobility . &quot;
automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ ams , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
the Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
there is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 motorway to try out the new technology .
in order that &quot; no extra liability risk will be imposed &quot; on drivers , the government wants to &quot; examine and , where necessary , adapt &quot; legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ ver@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
with automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
however dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles &quot; are not anticipated until 2020 &quot; on public roads .
the authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
&quot; digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; says SP@@ D transport politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
however the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers &apos; personal data must be conclu@@ sively clarified .
and Germans still view dri@@ ver@@ less cars scep@@ tically - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dek@@ ra , presented to the IA@@ A on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
in France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonom@@ ously driven cars by 20@@ 25 and in the USA 33 percent .
anyway drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
according to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motor@@ ways in free @-@ f@@ lowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ ams .
approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l not to play in team and doub@@ les in European Championship
as things stand , the D@@ ussel@@ dorf player plans to play only in the sing@@ les in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made on 22 September .
&quot; it is a major loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ds heard about it this morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to pick up the title without Tim@@ o , &quot; said national coach J@@ ör@@ g Ro@@ ss@@ kop@@ f during European Championship training in D@@ ussel@@ dorf .
at this time Bol@@ l was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with spons@@ ors in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champi@@ on is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favour@@ ites , &quot; declared individual European champi@@ on Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ ov .
but the Ham@@ e@@ lin player , who is the top seed in E@@ k@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also re@@ members the European Championship in Schwe@@ chat in 2013 .
&quot; we didn &apos;t have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that is what we need to focus on , &quot; declared the world number five .
the English football national player Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
in the course of the tackle in the Champi@@ ons League game with P@@ SV Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the def@@ ender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and after a long b@@ out of treatment was replaced .
initial diagnosis indicates that the 20 @-@ year @-@ old who used to play with Bas@@ tian Schw@@ ein@@ stei@@ ger has broken his ti@@ bia .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works chamber of hor@@ rors : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look alar@@ m@@ ingly human thanks to video pro@@ jection .
they wear the French designer &apos;s spectacular cre@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onna &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and also put men in sk@@ ir@@ ts .
&quot; these days I can &apos;t say I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture any longer , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , nowadays it &apos;s real , &quot; says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition , &quot; From the Si@@ de@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk , &quot; which can be seen in the Kun@@ sth@@ alle at the H@@ yp@@ o Culture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluc@@ tant attitude to a show about his own character .
originally he was against it because , &quot; For me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit like death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get put into a museum .
this remarkable collection has already been st@@ aged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
it &apos;s about a lot more than beautiful clothes , &quot; says the director of the Kun@@ sth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhib@@ its provide an insight into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
the show is not constructed chron@@ olo@@ gically , but it is a brilli@@ antly cho@@ re@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins &apos; hair .
according to cur@@ ator T@@ hier@@ ry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators car@@ ted 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest there was also a special treat in store : a Le@@ der@@ ho@@ sen out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Mad@@ onna
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are cle@@ ver@@ er than men &quot; ) and in people who are a little different , says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
even Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old te@@ d@@ dy is on show in the exhibition .
he represents the designer &apos;s first , tent@@ ative steps at fashion .
as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and he was bad at football ) , he dre@@ ssed his te@@ d@@ dy in br@@ as and dre@@ sses .
his parents did not allow him to play with dol@@ ls .
later he taught himself fashion design .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and scrut@@ in@@ ised other designers &apos; cre@@ ations , Gau@@ l@@ tier told us in Munich .
of course , later I bought them .
he was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
decoration instead of cur@@ tains - P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace as a fashion ni@@ che
there used to be long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en making many metres
of em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered fabri@@ cs and lac@@ es in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and cur@@ tains .
this is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ desp@@ it@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is once more important .
in the early days of P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home textile industry - and now it is being re@@ discovered as a ni@@ che .
Rein@@ hardt gave a few examples : l@@ ace in decoration , for accessories such as bags and for traditional co@@ st@@ umes .
generally , so @-@ called vin@@ tage fashion , based on style eras from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a ni@@ che is no longer in the market .
we are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Mo@@ desp@@ it@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spit@@ ze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien trade association .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
there are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more che@@ ap@@ ly in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weak@@ ening slightly .
this is enough reason for new directions .
the trade association is also trying to score with environmental consci@@ ousness , as Cor@@ deli@@ a Bau@@ er of Sti@@ ck@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explains . &quot; as of this year we have implemented a se@@ al of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ olo@@ gically and socially compatible .
Rein@@ hardt added , &quot; This also applies to the materials we use . &quot;
qualified designer U@@ te Schmi@@ dt te@@ aches in the fac@@ ul@@ ty for applied arts at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West Sax@@ ony University of Z@@ wick@@ au and speciali@@ ses in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y and l@@ ace .
in order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a field of tension between the designers &apos; newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , &quot; says Schmi@@ dt .
this is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revitali@@ sed the historic snow@@ ball l@@ ace .
the machines em@@ bro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in selected places .
P@@ lau@@ en master gol@@ ds@@ mith Bi@@ an@@ ca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this . &quot; in the past I had no use for traditional P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball l@@ ace for her je@@ well@@ ery .
using an elabor@@ ate process she embo@@ sses the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose fore@@ fa@@ thers lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a me@@ mento .
so with my je@@ well@@ ery I see myself as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ador for P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace .
Dis@@ ney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t inter@@ fere with legen@@ ds , but Dis@@ ney is dar@@ ing to make a new film of the classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; anyway .
but according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; it is not going to be a re@@ make but a sort of sequ@@ el , set 20 years after the first film with the ma@@ gical n@@ ann@@ y .
it is about the n@@ ann@@ y &apos;s experiences with the Ban@@ ks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is not yet certain .
but the director has been decided : Ro@@ b Mar@@ shall , whose most recent film was &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods . &quot;
XI urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping told a group t@@ asked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening @-@ up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for De@@ ep@@ ening Over@@ all Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border @-@ control policies , encouraging state @-@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and over@@ hau@@ ling the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off @-@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ locating resources , ensuring a law @-@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it dele@@ gates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreign@@ ers to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Premier L@@ i Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang , and senior leaders Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neuro@@ tox@@ in .
the consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . &quot; risks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregn@@ ant women and small children , &quot; declared Mat@@ thias Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt , the limits for the neuro@@ tox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per ki@@ lo@@ gram of fish for &quot; economic reasons . &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish however are today so heavily contam@@ inated with mercury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
once the limit has been doub@@ led , however , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
in return for this relaxation the EU , according to F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per ki@@ lo@@ gram .
but F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch describes this as a &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller pre@@ y fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today .
the reduction for small fish therefore is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous diver@@ sion@@ ary t@@ acti@@ c which helps only the economy , &quot; decla@@ res Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt .
mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumul@@ ates largely in the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
for this reason the German government has issued a warning that &quot; even low levels , particularly in un@@ born children , can lead to damage to the ner@@ vous system . &quot;
the German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a &quot; health risk to the general population &quot; is not anticipated .
mercury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bun@@ de@@ stag member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , discharge more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; exten@@ sively exceeded on a long @-@ term basis , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
in the past year , Europe @-@ wide al@@ er@@ ts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under : www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ sil@@ ber @-@ ak@@ tion@@ .@@ food@@ wat@@ ch@@ .de
